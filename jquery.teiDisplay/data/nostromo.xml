            <p>The following text is part of a pilot project for the Editing Modernism in Canada (EMiC) sponsored Modernist Versions Project (MVP) that will allow scholars to trace the genetic difference between editions of modernist texts.  The desired outcome for the pilot project is for scholars to be able to use the tool to cross reference the genetic transformations between the 1904 Harper's edition of Joseph Conrad's Nostromo with the version published in T.P.'s Weekly between 1903 and 1904.</p>       </projectDesc>

        <p>Directly the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">cargo boat</placeName> had slipped away from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName> and got lost in the darkness of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbor">harbour</placeName> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EuropeansOfSulaco">Europeans of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName></rs> separated, to prepare for the coming of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monterists">Monterist regime</rs>, which was approaching <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Higuerota">mountains</placeName> as well as from the sea.</p>
        <p>This bit of manual work in loading the silver was their last concerted action. It ended the three days of danger, during which according to the newspaper press of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Europe">Europe</placeName>, their energy had preserved the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> from the calamities of popular disorder. At the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#jetty">shore end of the jetty</placeName> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> said good-night and turned back.  His intention was to walk the planks of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName> till the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#EsmeraldaSteamer">steamer from <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Esmerelda">Esmeralda</placeName></placeName> turned up.  The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayEngineers">engineers of the railway staff</rs>, collecting <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayWorkers">their Basque and Italian workmen</rs>, marched them away to the <placeName ref="railway">railway yards</placeName>, leaving the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Custom House</placeName>, so well defended on the first day of the riot, standing open to the four winds of heaven.  <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayWorkers">Their men<!-- "their" refers to the railway engineers --></rs> had conducted themselves bravely and faithfully during the famous "three days" of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>.  In a great part this faithfulness and that courage had been exercised in self-defense rather than in the cause of those material interests to which <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> had pinned his faith.  Amongst the cries of the <rs ref="serOgarphies.xml#mob">mob</rs> not the least loud had been the cry of death to foreigners.  It was, indeed, a lucky circumstance for <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> that the relations of those imported workmen with the people of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">country</placeName> had been uniformly bad from the first.</p>
        <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor Monygham</rs>, going to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">door of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Viola</rs>'s kitchen</placeName>, observed this retreat marking the end of the foreign interference, this withdrawal of the army of material progress from the field of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName> revolutions.</p>
        <p>Algarrobe torches carried on the outskirts of the moving body sent their penetrating aroma into his nostrils; and their light, sweeping along the front of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">house</placeName>, made the letters of the inscription "<placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">Albergo d'Italia Una</placeName>" leap out black from end to end of the long wall. His eyes blinked in the clear blaze. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">Several young men</rs>, mostly fair and tall, shepherding this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">mob</rs> of dark bronzed heads, surmounted by the glint of slanting rifle barrels nodded to him familiarly as they went by. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> was a well-known character. Some of them wondered what he was doing there. Then on the flank of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">their workmen</rs> they tramped on, following the line of rails.</p>
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Withdrawing your people from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">Harbour</placeName>?"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, addressing himself to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Chief Engineer of the <cb n="624.817.2"/> <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway</placeName></rs>, who had accompanied <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> so far on his way to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>, walking by the side of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EICHorse">horse</rs>, with his hand on the saddle-bow.  They had stopped just outside the open door to let the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">workmen</rs> cross the road.</p>
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"As quick as I can. We are not a political faction,"</said> answered the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer</rs> meaningly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"And we are not going to give our new rulers a handle against the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway" >railway</placeName>. You approve me, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Gould</rs>?"</said></p>
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"Absolutely,"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>'s impassive voice, high up and outside the dim parallelogram of light falling on the road through the open door.</p>
        <p>With <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> expected from one side, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedro Montero</rs> from the other, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer-in-Chief</rs>'s only anxiety now was to avoid a collision with either. <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>, for him, was a railway station, a terminus, workshops, a great accumulation of stores. As against the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">mob</rs> the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway</placeName> defended its property, but politically the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway</placeName> was neutral. He was a brave man; and in that spirit of neutrality he had carried proposals of truce to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">self-appointed chiefs of the popular party</rs> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">deputies Fuentes and Gamacho</rs>.	Bullets were still flying about when he had crossed the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">plaza</placeName> on that mission, waving above his head a white napkin belonging to the table linen of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">Amarilla Club</placeName>.</p>        
        <p>He was rather proud of this exploit; and reflecting that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, busy all day with the wounded in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">patio</placeName> of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">Casa Gould</placeName> had not had time to hear the news, he began a succinct narrative. He had communicated to them the intelligence from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Construction">Construction Camp</placeName> as to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedro Montero</rs>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">brother of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">victorious general</rs></rs>, he had assured them, could be expected at <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> at any time now.  This news (as he anticipated), when shouted out of the window by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Señor Gamacho</rs>, induced a rush of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">mob</rs> along the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRoad">Campo Road</placeName> towards <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Rincon">Rincon</placeName>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">two deputies</rs> also, after shaking hands with him effusively, mounted and galloped off to meet the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">great man</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"I have misled them a little as to the time,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Chief Engineer</rs> confessed. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"However hard he rides, he can scarcely get here before the morning. But my object is attained. I've secured several hours' peace for the losing party. But I did not tell them anything about <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, for fear they would take it into their heads to try to get hold of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> again, either to oppose him or welcome him -- there's no saying which. There was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Gould</rs>'s silver, on which rests the remnant of our hopes. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>'s retreat had to be thought of, too. I think the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway</placeName> has done pretty well by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayFriends">its friends</rs> without compromising itself hopelessly. Now the parties must be left to themselves."</said></p> <cb n="624.817.3"/>
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"<placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName> for the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguaneros">Costaguaneros</rs>,"</said> interjected the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> sardonically <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"it is a fine country, and they have raised a fine crop of hates, vengeances, murder, and rapine -- those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguaneros">sons of the country</rs>."</said></p>
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"Well, I am one of them,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>'s voice sounded calmly,<said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles"> "and I must be going on to see to my own crop of trouble. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">My wife</rs> has driven straight on, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>?"</said></p>
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Yes. All was quiet on this side. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> has taken the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">two girls</rs> with her."</said></p>
        <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> rode on and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer-in-Chief</rs> followed the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">indoors</placeName>.</p>
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"That <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">man</rs> is calmness personified,"</said> he said, appreciatively, dropping on a bench, and stretching his well-shaped legs in cycling stockings nearly across the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">doorway</placeName>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"He must be extremely sure of himself."</said></p>
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"If that's all he is sure of, then he is sure of nothing,"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>. He had perched himself again on the end of the table. He nursed his cheek in the palm of one hand, while the other sustained the elbow. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"It is the last thing a man ought to be sure of."</said> The candle, half consumed and burning dimly with a long wick, lighted up from below his inclined face, whose expression, affected by the drawn-in cicatrices in the cheeks, had something vaguely unnatural, an exaggerated remorseful bitterness. As he sat there he had the air of meditating upon sinister things.  Though he knew him well, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer-in-Chief</rs> gazed at him for a time before he protested. </p>
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"I really don't see that. For me there seems to be nothing else. However --"</said></p>
        <p>He was a wise man, but he could not quite conceal his contempt for that sort of paradox; in fact, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> was not liked by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EuropeansOfSulaco">Europeans of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName></rs>. Through his intercourse with all those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EuropeansOfSulaco">enterprising men</rs> there ran an undertone of disparagement, and with his outward aspect of an outcast, which he preserved even in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>'s drawing-room</placeName>, he provoked unfavourable criticism. There could be no doubt of his intelligence, and as he had lived for over twenty years in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName> the pessimism of his outlook could not be altogether ignored. But instinctively, in self-defence of their activities and hopes, his hearers put it to the account of some hidden imperfection in the man's character. It was known that many years before, when quite young, he had been made by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoGuzman">Guzman Bento</rs> Chief Medical Officer of the army. Not one of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EuropeansOfSulaco">Europeans</rs> then in the service of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName> had been so much liked and trusted by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoGuzman">fierce old Dictator</rs>.</p> <cb n="624.818.1"/><pb n="818"/> 
        <p>Afterwards his story was not so clear. It lost itself amongst the innumerable tales of conspiracies and plots against the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoGuzman">tyrant</rs> as a stream is lost in an arid belt of sandy country before it emerges, diminished and troubled, perhaps on the other side. He made no secret of it that he had lived for years in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">wildest parts of the Republic</placeName>, wandering with almost <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#unknownTribes">unknown Indian tribes</rs> in the great forests of the far interior where the great <geogFeat>rivers</geogFeat> have their sources. But it was mere aimless wandering; he had written nothing, collected nothing, brought nothing for science out of the twilight of the forests, which seemed to cling to his battered personality limping about <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>, where it had drifted in casually, only to get stranded on the shores of the <geogFeat>sea</geogFeat>.</p>
        <p>It was also known that he had lived in a state of destitution till the arrival of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Goulds">Goulds</rs> from <placeName>Europe</placeName>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Senora Emilia</rs> had taken up the mad <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">English doctor</rs>, when it became apparent that for all his savage independence he could be tamed by kindness. Perhaps it was only hunger that had tamed him.  In years gone by he had certainly been acquainted with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHenry">Charles Gould's father</rs> in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SantaMarta">Santa Martha</placeName>; and now, no matter what were the dark passages of his history, as the medical officer of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName> he became a recognised personality. He was recognised, but not unreservedly accepted. So much defiant eccentricity and such an outspoken scorn for man-kind seemed to point to mere recklessness of judgement, the bravado of guilt. Besides, since he had become again of some account vague whispers had been heard that years ago, when fallen into disgrace and thrown into <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoPrison">prison</placeName> by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoGuzman">Guzman Bento</rs> at the time of the so-called Grand Conspiracy, he had betrayed some of his best friends among the conspirators. Nobody pretended to believe that whisper; the whole story of the Great Conspiracy was hopelessly involved and obscure; it is almost admitted in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName> that there never had been a conspiracy except in the diseased imagination of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoGuzman">Tyrant</rs>; and, therefore, nothing and no one to betray; though the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguaneros">most distinguished Costaguaneros</rs> had been imprisoned and executed upon that accusation. The procedure had dragged on for years, decimating the better class like a pestilence. The mere expression of sorrow for the fate of executed kinsmen had been punished with death. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosJose">Don José Avellanos</rs> was perhaps the only one living who knew the whole story of those unspeakable cruelties. He had suffered from them himself, and he, with a shrug of the shoulders and a nervous, jerky gesture of the arm, was wont to put away from him, as it were, every allusion to it. But whatever the reason, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, a personage in the administration of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">Gould Concession</placeName>, treated with reverent awe by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#miners">miners</rs>, and indulged in his peculiarities by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>, remained somehow outside the pale.</p>
        <p>It was not from any liking for the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer-In-Chief</rs> had lingered in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">inn upon the plain</placeName>. He liked <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Viola</rs> much better. He had come to look upon the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">Albergo d'Italia Una</placeName> as a dependence of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway</placeName>. Many of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayWorkers">his subordinates <!-- "his" refers to EIC --></rs> had their quarters there. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>'s interest in the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaFamily">family</rs> conferred upon it a sort of distinction. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer-in-Chief</rs>,<cb n="624.818.2"/> with an <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayWorkers">army of workers</rs> under his orders, appreciated the moral influence of the <rs ref= "serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Garibaldino</rs> upon <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayWorkers">his country-men <!-- "his" refers to Giorgio Viola and "country" refers to Italy --></rs>. His austere, old-world Republicanism had a severe, soldier-like standard of faithfulness and duty as if the world were a battlefield where men had to fight for the sake of universal love and brotherhood, instead of a more or less large share of the booty.</p>
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Poor old chap</rs>,"</said> he said, after he had heard the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>'s account of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">Theresa</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"He'll never be able to keep the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">place</placeName> going by himself. I shall be sorry."</said></p>
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"He's quite alone up there,"</said> grunted <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor Monygham</rs> with a toss of his head towards the narrow staircase.<said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Every living soul has cleared out, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> took the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">girls</rs> away just now. It might not be over safe for them out here before very long. Of course, as a doctor I can do nothing more here; but she has asked me to stay with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Viola</rs>, and as I have no horse to get back to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName>, where I ought to be, I made no difficulty to stay. They can do without me in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>."</said></p>
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"I have a good mind to remain with you, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, till we see whether anything happens to-night at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>,"</said> declared the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer-in-Chief</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"He must not be molested by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Soitllo">Sotillo</rs>'s soldiery</rs>, who may push on as far as this at once. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Soitllo">Sotillo</rs> used to be very cordial to me at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">Goulds</placeName> and at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">club</placeName>. How that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">man</rs>'ll ever dare to look any of his friends here in the face I can't imagine."</said></p> 
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"He'll no doubt begin by shooting some of them to get over the first awkwardness,"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Nothing in this <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName> serves better <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">your military man</rs> who has changed sides than a few summary executions."</said> He spoke with a gloomy positiveness that left no room for protest. The <rs ref="serEIC">Engineer-in-Chief</rs> did not attempt any. He simply nodded several time, regretfully, then said:</p> 
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"I think we shall be able to mount you in the morning, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayWorkers">Our peons</rs> have recovered some of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayHorses">our stampeded horses</rs>. By riding hard and taking a wide circuit by <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#LosHatos">Los Hatos</placeName> and along the edge of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#LosHatos">forest</placeName>, clear of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Rincon">Rincon</placeName> altogether, you may hope to reach the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé bridge</placeName> without being interfered with. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName> is just now, to my mind, the safest place for anybody at all compromised. I only wish the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway</placeName> was as difficult to touch."</said></p> 
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Am I compromised?"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor Monygham</rs> brought out slowly after a short silence.</p> 
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"The whole <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">Gould Concession</placeName> is compromised. It could not have remained for ever outside the political life of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName> -- if those convulsions may be called life. The thing is -- can it be touched? The moment was bound to come when neutrality would become impossible and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> understood this well. I believe he is prepared for every extremity. A man of his sort has never contemplated remaining indefinitely at the mercy of ignorance and corruption. It was like being a prisoner in a cavern of banditti with the price of your ransom in your pocket, and buying your life from day to day. Your mere safety, not your liberty, mind, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>. I know what I am talking about. The image at which you shrug your shoulders is perfectly correct, especially if you conceive such a prisoner endowed with the power of replenishing<cb n="624.818.3"/> his pocket by means as remote from the faculties of his captors as if they were magic. You must have understood that as well as I do, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>. He was in the position of the goose with the golden eggs. I broached this matter to him as far back as <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SirJohn">Sir John</rs>'s visit here. The prisoner of stupid and greedy banditti is always at the mercy of the first imbecile ruffian, who may blowout his brains in a fit of temper or for some prospect of an immediate big haul. The tale of killing the goose with the golden eggs has not been evolved for nothing out of the wisdom of mankind. It is a story that shall never grow old. That is why <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> in his obscure, dumb way has countenanced the Ribierist Mandate, the first public act that promised him safety on other than venal grounds. Ribierism has failed, as everything merely rational fails in this <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName>. But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Gould</rs> remains logical in wishing to save this big lot of silver. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>'s plan of a counter-revolution may be practicable or not, it may have a chance, or it may not have a chance. With all my experience of this revolutionary continent, I can hardly yet look at their methods seriously. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs> has been reading to us his draft of a proclamation, and talking very well for two hours about his plan of action. He had arguments which should have appeared solid enough if we, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#membersOfOldOrganizations">members of old, stable political and national organisations</rs>, were not startled by the mere idea of a new state evolved like this out of the head of a scoffing young man fleeing for his life, with a proclamation in his pocket, to a rough, jeering, half-bred swashbuckler, who in this part of the world is called a general. It sounds like a comic fairy tale and behold, it may come off; because it is true to the very spirit of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName>."</said></p>
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Is the silver gone off, then?"</said> asked the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> moodily. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Chief Engineer</rs> pulled out his watch.</p> 
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"By <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>'s reckoning, and he ought to know it has been gone long enough now to be some three or four miles outside the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>; and, as <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Mitchell</rs> says, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> is the sort of seaman to make the best of his opportunities."</said> Here the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> grunted so heavily that the other changed his tone.</p> 
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"You have a poor opinion of that move, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>? But why? <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> has got to play his game out, though he is not the man to formulate his conduct even to himself, perhaps, let alone to others. It may be that the game has been partly suggested to him by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Holroyd">Holroyd</rs>; but it accords with his character, too; and that is why it has been so successful. Haven't they come to calling him '<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">El Rey de Sulaco</rs>' in <placeName ref="SantaMartha">Sta. Martha</placeName>. A nickname may be the best record of a success. That's what I call putting the face of a joke upon the body of a truth. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">My dear sir</rs>, when I first arrived in <placeName ref="SantaMartha">Sta. Martha</placeName> I was struck by the way all those journalists, demagogues, members of congress, and all those generals and judges cringed before a sleepy-eyed little advocate simply because he was the plenipotentiary of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">Gould Concession</placeName>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SirJohn">Sir John</rs> when he came out was impressed, too."</said></p> 
        <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"A new State, with that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">plump dandy, Decoud</rs>, for the first President,"</said> mused <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, nursing his cheek and swinging his legs all the time.

                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"Upon my word, and why not?"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Chief Engineer</rs> retorted in an unexpectedly earnest and confidential voice. It was as if something subtle in the air of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName> had inoculated him with the local faith in "pronunciamientos." All at once he began to talk, like an expert revolutionist, of the instrument ready to hand in the intact army at <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Cayta">Cayta</placeName>, which could be brought back in seven days to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> if only <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs> managed to make his way at once down the coast. For the military chief there was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs>, who had nothing but a bullet to expect from <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">Montero</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">his former professional rival <!-- "his" refers to Barrios --></rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">bitter enemy <!-- Barrios' enemy --></rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs>'s concurrence was assured. As to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BarriosMen">his army</rs>, it had nothing to expect from <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">Montero</rs> either; not even a month's pay. From that point of view the existence of the treasure was of enormous importance. The mere knowledge that it had been saved from the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monterists">Monterists</rs> would be a strong inducement for the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BarriosMen"><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Cayta">Cayta</placeName> troops</rs> to embrace the cause of the new State.</p> 
                <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> turned round and contemplated <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">his companion <!-- "his" refers to Monygham --></rs> for some time.</p>
                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"This <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>, I see, is a persuasive young beggar,"</said> he remarked at last.<said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"And pray is it for this, then, that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> has let the whole lot of ingots go out to sea in charge of that good-for-nothing <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>?"</said></p> 
                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>,"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer-in-Chief</rs><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"has said no more about his motive than usual.

They understand each other's imaginative side. One is thirty, the other nearly sixty, and they have been made for each other. To be a millionaire -- and such a millionaire as <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Holroyd">Holroyd</rs> -- is like being eternally young. The audacity of youth reckons upon what it fancies an unlimited time at its disposal, but a millionaire has unlimited means in his hand -- which is better. One's time on earth is an uncertain quantity, but about the long reach of millions there is no doubt. The introduction of a pure form of Christianity into this continent is a dream for a youthful enthusiast, and I have been trying to explain to you why <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Holroyd">Holroyd</rs> at fifty-eight is like a man on the threshold of life, and better, too. He's not a missionary, but the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName> holds just that for him. I assure you in sober truth, that he could not manage to keep this out of a strictly<cb n="704.5.2"/> business conference upon the finances of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName> he had with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SirJohn">Sir John</rs> a couple of years ago. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SirJohn">Sir John</rs> mentioned it with amazement in a letter he wrote to me here, from <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanFrancisco">San Francisco</placeName>, when on his way <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SirJohnHome">home</placeName>. Upon my word, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, things seem to be worth nothing by what they are in themselves.

                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Bah,"</said> interrupted the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, without stopping for an instant the idle swinging movement of his legs. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Self-flattery.

                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"Why are you uneasy about it, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>?"</said></p>
                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I uneasy! And what the devil is it to me? I put no spiritual value into my desires, or my opinions, or my actions.

It's impossible, Have you met the impossible face to face -- or have you, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Napoleon">Napoleon</rs> of railways</rs>, no such word in your dictionary?"</said></p> 
                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"Is she bound to have a very bad time of it?"</said> asked the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Chief Engineer</rs> with humane concern.</p> 
                <p>Slow heavy footsteps moved across the planks above the heavy hard wood beams of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">kitchen</placeName>. Then down the narrow opening of the staircase made in the thickness of the wall, and narrow enough to be defended by one man against twenty enemies, came the murmur of two voices, one faint and broken, the other deep and gentle answering it, and in its graver tone covering the weaker sound.</p> 
                <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham serOgraphies.xml#EIC">two men</rs> remained still and silent till the murmurs ceased then the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> shrugged his shoulders and muttered:</p> 
                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Yes she's bound to. And I could do nothing if I went up now."</said></p> 
                <p>A long period of silence above and below ensued.</p> 
                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"I fancy,"</said> began the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer</rs>, in a subdued voice, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"that you mistrust <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>'s Capataz</rs>."</said></p> 
                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Mistrust him!"</said> muttered the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, through his teeth. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I believe him capable of anything -- even of the most absurd fidelity.

The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">poor woman</rs> up there wanted to see him, and I let him go up to her. The dying must not be contradicted, you know. She seemed then fairly calm and resigned, but the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">scoundrel</rs> in those ten minutes or so has done<cb n="704.5.3"/> or said something which seems to have driven her into despair. You know,"</said> went on the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, hesitatingly, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"women are so very unaccountable in every position, and at all times of life, that I thought sometimes she was in a way, don't you see, in love with him -- the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">rascal</rs> has his own charm indubitably, or he would not have made the conquest of all the populace of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>. No, no, I am not absurd. I may have given a wrong name to some strong sentiment for him on her part, to an unreasonable and simple attitude a woman is apt to take up emotionally towards a man. She used to abuse him to me frequently, which, of course, is not inconsistent with my idea. Not at all. It looked to me as if she were always thinking of him. He was something important in her life. You know, I have seen a lot of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaFamily">those people</rs>. Whenever I came down from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> used to ask me to keep an eye on them. She likes Italians; she has lived a long time in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Italy">Italy</placeName>, I believe, and she took a special fancy to that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Garibaldino</rs>. A remarkable chap enough. A rugged an dreamy character, living in the republicanism of his young days as if in a cloud. He has encouraged much of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>'s confounded nonsense -- the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">high-strung, exalted old beggar</rs>!"</said></p>  
                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"What sort of nonsense?"</said> wondered the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Chief Engineer</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">I found the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> always a very shrewd and sensible fellow, absolutely fearless, and remarkably useful. A perfect handy man. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SirJohn">Sir John</rs> was greatly impressed by his resourcefulness and attention when he made that overland journey from <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#StaMartha">Santa Martha</placeName>. Later on, as you might have heard, he rendered us a service by disclosing to the then <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ChiefOfPolice">Chief of Police</rs> the presence in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayThieves">some professional thieves</rs> who came from a distance to wreck and rob our weekly pay train. He has certainly organised the lighterage service of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> for the O.S.N. Company with great ability. He knows how to make himself obeyed, foreigner though he is. It is true that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">Cargadores</rs> are strangers here too, for the most part-- immigrants, Islenos."</said></p>
                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">His prestige is his fortune,"</said> muttered the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, sourly.</p>
                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">man</rs> has proved his trustworthiness up to the hilt on innumerable occasions and in all sorts of ways,"</said> argued the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer.</rs> <said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"When this question of the silver arose, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> naturally was very warmly of the opinion that his <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> was the only man fit for the trust. As a sailor, of course, I suppose so. But as a man, don't you know, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Gould</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>, and myself judged that it didn't matter in the least who went. Any boatman would have done just as well. Pray, what could a thief<cb n="704.6.1"/><pb n="6"/> do with such a lot of ingots? If he ran off with them he would have in the end to land somewhere, and how could he conceal his cargo from the knowledge of the people ashore? We dismissed that consideration from our minds. Moreover, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs> was going. There have been occasions when the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> has been more implicitly trusted."</said></p> 
                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"He took a slightly different view,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> said. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I heard him declare in this very <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">room</placeName> that it would be the most desperate affair of his life.

And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs>, who to-morrow will be probably one of our high officials, is a stranger too -- an Isleno. He might have been a Cargadore on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">O.S.N. wharf</placeName> had he not (the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Posadero">posadero of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Rincon">Rincon</placeName></rs> is ready to swear it) murdered a pedlar in the woods and stolen his pack to begin life on. And do you think that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs>, then, would have ever become the hero with the democracy of this place, like our <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>? Of course not. He isn't half the man. No; decidedly, I think that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> is a fool."</said></p> 
                <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>'s talk was distasteful to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">great builder of railways</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"It is impossible to argue that point,"</said> he said philosophically. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"Each man has his gifts.

                <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, pacing the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName>, was asking himself the same question. There was always the doubt whether the warning of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EsmeraldaTelegraphist"><placeName ref="Esmeralda">Esmeralda</placeName> telegraphist</rs> -- a fragmentary and interrupted message -- had been properly <cb n="701.6.2"/> understood. However, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">good man</rs> had made up his mind not to go to bed till daylight, if even then. He imagined himself to have rendered an enormous service to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>. When he thought of the saved silver he rubbed his hands together with satisfaction. In his simple way he was proud at being a party to this extremely clever expedient. It was he who had given it a practical shape by suggesting the possibility of intercepting at sea the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#northBoundSteamer">northbound steamer</placeName>. And it was advantageous to his company too, which would have lost a valuable freight if the treasure had been left ashore to be confiscated. The pleasure of disappointing the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monterists">Monterists</rs> was also very great. Authoritative by temperament and the long habit of command, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> was no democrat. He even went so far as to profess a contempt for parliamentarism itself. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ribiera">His Excellency Don Vincente Ribiera</rs>,"</said> he used to say, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"whom I and that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">fellow of mine</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, had the honour, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, and the pleasure of saving from a cruel death, deferred too much to his Congress. It was a mistake -- a distinct mistake, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>."</said></p>
                <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">guileless old seaman</rs> superintending the O.S.N. service imagined that the last three days had exhausted every startling surprise the political life of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName> could offer. He used to confess afterwards that the events which followed surpassed his imagination. To begin with, <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> (because of the seizure of the cables and the disorganisation of the steam service) remained for a whole month cut off from the rest of the world like a besieged city. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"One would not have believed it possible; but so it was, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>. A whole calendar month."</said></p>
                <p>The account of the extraordinary things that happened during that time, and the powerful emotions he experienced, acquired a wearisome impressiveness from the pompous manner of his personal narrative.</p>
                <p>He opened it always by assuring his hearer that he was <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"in the thick of things from first to last."</said> Then he would begin by describing the getting away of the silver, and his natural anxiety lest "<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">his fellow</rs>" in charge of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</placeName> should make some mistake. Apart from the loss of so much precious metal, the life of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Señor Martin Decoud</rs>, an agreeable, wealthy, and well-informed young gentleman, would have been jeopardised through his falling into the hands of his political enemies. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> also admitted that in his solitary vigil on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName> he had felt a certain measure of concern for the future of the whole <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"A feeling, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>,"</said> he explained, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"perfectly comprehensible in a man properly grateful for the many kindnesses received from the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">best families of merchants</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">other native gentlemen of independent means</rs>, who barely saved by us from the excesses of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">mob</rs>, seemed, to my mind's eye, destined to become the prey in person and fortune of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard">native soldiery</rs>, which, as is well known, behave with regrettable barbarity to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguaneros">inhabitants</rs> during their civil commotions. And then, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, there were the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Goulds">Goulds</rs>, for both of whom, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">man</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">wife</rs>, I could not but entertain the warmest feelings deserved by their hospitality and kindness. I felt, too, the dangers of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AmarillaMen">gentlemen of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Armarilla">Armarilla Club</placeName></rs>, who<cb n="701.6.3"/> had made me honorary member, and had treated me with uniform regard and civility, both in my capacity of Consular Agent and as Superintendent of an important Steam Service. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Miss Antonia Avellanos</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">most beautiful and accomplished young lady</rs> whom it had ever been my privilege to speak to, was not a little in my mind, I confess. How the interests of my company would be affected by the impending change of officials claimed a large share of my attention too. In short, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, I was extremely anxious and very tired, as you may suppose, by the exciting and memorable events in which I had taken my little part. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN">Company's building</placeName> containing <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN">my residence</placeName> was within five minute's walk, with the attraction of some supper and of my hammock (I always take my nightly rest in a hammock, as the most suitable to the climate); but somehow, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, though evidently I could do nothing for anyone by remaining about, I could not tear myself away from that <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName>, where the fatigue made me stumble painfully at times.</said></p>
                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">The night was excessively dark -- the darkest I remember in my life; so that I began to think that the arrival of the transport from <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Esmeralda">Esmeralda</placeName> could not possibly take place before daylight, owing to the difficulty of navigating the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gulf">Gulf</placeName>.</said></p>
                <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">The mosquitoes bit like fury. We have been infested here with mosquitoes before the late improvements; a peculiar harbour brand, sir, renowned for its ferocity. They were like a cloud about my head, and I shouldn't wonder that but for their attacks I would have dozed off as I walked up and down, and got a heavy fall. I kept on smoking cigar after cigar, more to protect myself from being eaten up alive than from any real relish for the weed. Then, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, when perhaps for the twentieth time I was approaching my watch to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">lighted end</placeName> in order to see the time, and observing with surprise that it wanted yet ten minutes to midnight, I heard the plash of a ship's propeller -- an unmistakeable sound to a sailor's ear on such a calm night. It was fate indeed, because they were advancing with precaution and dead slow, both on account of the darkness and from their desire of not revealing too soon their presence: a very unnecessary care, because, I verily believe, in all the enormous extent of this <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> I was the only living soul about. Even the usual <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbourWorkers">staff of watchmen</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbourWorkers">others</rs> had been absent from their posts for several nights owing to the disturbances. I stood stock still, after dropping and stamping out my cigar -- a circumstance highly agreeable. I should think, to the mosquitoes, if I may judge from the state of my face next morning. I had full leisure to concern myself with it, being deprived of my liberty by  most arbitrary and brutal abuse of power on the part of that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">scoundrelly Colonel Sotillo</rs>. Something utterly inconceivable, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>: more like the proceedings of a maniac than the action of a sane man, however lost to all sense of honour and decency. But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> was furious at the failure of his thievish scheme."</said></p><pb/>

        <div type="chapter" n="3.2.37">
            <head>CHAPTER II. (continued).</head>
            <p>In this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> was right. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> was indeed infuriated. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> however had not been arrested at once; a vivid curiosity induced him to remain on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName> (which is nearly three hundred and fifty yards long) to see, or rather hear, the whole process of disembarkation. Concealed by the railway truck used for silver, which had been run back afterwards to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#jetty">shore end of the jetty</placeName>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> saw the small detachments -- thrown forwards to ascertain whether there was, the likelihood of any resistance being offered -- pass by, taking different directions upon the plain. Meantime the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">troops</rs> were being landed and formed into a column, whose head crept up gradually so close to him that he made it out, barring nearly the whole width of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName>, only a very few yards from him. Then the low, shuffling, murmuring, clinking sounds ceased, and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">whole mass</rs> remained for about an hour motionless and silent, awaiting the return of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">scouts</rs>. On land nothing was to be heard except the deep baying of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayDogs">mastiffs</rs> at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway yards</placeName>, answered by the faint barking of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#townDogs">curs</rs> infesting the outer limits of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>. A detached knot of dark shapes stood in front of the head of the column.</p> 
            <p>Presently the picket at the end of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName> began to challenge in undertones <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">single figures</rs> approaching from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plain">plain</placeName>. Those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">messengers</rs> sent back from the scouting parties flung to their <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">comrades</rs> brief sentences, as to hang found nothing but unburied bodies and other traces of recent fighting. They passed rapidly, becoming lost in the great motionless mass, to make their report to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">staff</rs>. It occurred to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> that his position could become disagreeable and perhaps dangerous, when suddenly, at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#jetty">head of the jetty</placeName>, there was a shout of command, a bugle call, followed by a stir and a rattling of arms, and a murmuring noise that ran right up the column. Near by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">a loud voice</rs> directed hurriedly, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">"Push that railway car out of the way."</said> At the rush of bare feet to execute the order <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> skipped back a pace or two; the car, suddenly impelled by many hands, flew away from him along the rails and before he know what had happened he found himself surrounded and seized by his arms and the collar of his coat.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">We have caught a man hiding here, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">mi teniente</rs>!"</said> cried <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMenMitchellCaptor">one of his captors <!-- "his" refers to Mitchell --></rs>.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#MitchellCaptor">"Hold him on one side till the rearguard comes along,"</said> answered the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MitchellCaptor">voice</rs>. The whole column streamed past <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> at a run, the thundering<cb n="708.37.2"/> noise of their feet dying away suddenly on the shore. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">His captors <!-- "his" refers to Mitchell --></rs> held him tightly, disregarding his assurance that he was an Englishman and his loud demands to be taken at once before <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">their commanding office</rs>. Finally he lapsed into dignified silence. With a hollow rumble of wheels on the plans a couple of field guns, dragged by hand, rolled by. Then, after a small body of men had marched past, escorting <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloPrisoners">four or five figures</rs> which walked in advance with a jingle of steel scabbards, he felt a tug at his arms and was ordered to come along. During the passage from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName> to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Custom House</placeName> it is to be feared that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> was subjected to certain indignities at the hands of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">soldiers</rs> -- such as jerks, thumps on the neck, forcible applications of the butt of a rifle to the small of his back. Their ideas of speed were not in accord with his notion of his dignity. He became flustered, flushed, and helpless. It was as if the world were coming to an end.</p> 
            <p>The long <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">building</placeName> was surrounded by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">troops</rs>, which were already piling arms by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">companies</rs> and preparing to pass the night lying on the ground in their ponchos with their sacks under their heads. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">Corporals</rs> moved with swinging lanterns posting <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">sentries</rs> all round the walls wherever there was a door or an opening. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> was taking his measures to protect his conquest as if it had indeed contained the treasure. His desire to make his fortune at one audacious stroke of genius had overmastered his reasoning faculties. He would not believe in the possibility of failure; the mere hint of such a thing made his brain reel with rage. Every circumstance pointing to it appeared incredible. The statement of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Hirsch</rs>, which was so absolutely fatal to his hopes, could by no means be admitted. It is true, too, that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Hirsch</rs>'s story had been told so incoherently, with such excessive signs of distraction, that it really looked improbable. It was extremely difficult, as the saying is, to make head or tail of it. On the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloShip">bridge of the steamer</placeName>, directly after his rescue, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">his officers</rs>, in their impatience and excitement, would not give the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">wretched man</rs> time to collect such few wits as remained to him. He ought to have been quieted, soothed, and re-assured, whereas he had been handled roughly, cuffed, shaken, and addressed in menacing tones. His struggles, his wriggles, his attempts to get down on his knees, followed by the most violent efforts to break ways, as if he meant incontinently to jump overboard, his shrieks and shrinking and cowering wild glances had filled them first with amazement, then with a doubt of his genuineness, as men are wont to<cb n="708.37.3"/> suspect the sincerity of every great passion. His Spanish, too, became so mixed up with German that the better half of his statements remained incomprehensible. He tried to propitiate them by calling them hochwohlgeboren herren, which in itself sounded suspicious. When admonished sternly not to trifle he repeated his entreaties and protestations of loyalty and innocence again in German obstinately, because he was not aware in what language he was speaking.  His identity, of course, was perfectly known as an inhabitant of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Esmeralda">Esmeralda</placeName>, but this made the matter no clearer. As he kept on forgetting <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>'s name, mixing him up with several other people he had seen in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">Casa Gould</placeName>, it looked as if they all had been in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</placeName> together; and for a moment <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> thought that he had drowned <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ribierist">every prominent Ribierist of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName></rs>. The improbability of such a thing threw a doubt upon the whole statement. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Hirsch</rs> was either mad or playing a part -- pretending fear and distraction on the spur of the moment to cover the truth. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>'s rapacity, excited to the highest pitch by the prospect of an immense booty, could believe in nothing adverse. This <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Jew</rs> might have been very much frightened by the accident, but he knew where the silver was concealed, and had invented this story, with his Jewish cunning, to put him entirely off the track as to what had been done with the treasure.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> had taken up his <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">quarters</placeName> on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">upper floor in a vast apartment</placeName> with heavy black beams. But there was no ceiling, and the eye lost itself in the darkness under the high pitch of the roof. The thick shutters stood open. On a long table could be seen a large inkstand some stumpy inky quill pens and two square wooden boxes, each holding half a hundredweight of sand. Sheets of grey coarse official paper bestrewed the floor. It must have been a room occupied by some higher official of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Customs</placeName>, because a large leathern armchair stood behind the table with other high-backed chairs scattered about. A net hammock was swung under one of the beams -- for the official's afternoon siesta, no doubt. A couple of candles stuck into tall iron candlesticks gave a dim reddish light. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs>'s hat, sword, and revolver lay between them, and a couple of his more trusty officers lounged gloomily against the table. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs> threw himself into the armchair, and a big negro with a sergeant's stripes on his ragged sleeve kneeling down pulled off his boots: <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>'s ebony moustache contrasted violently with the livid colouring of his cheeks. His eyes were sombre and as if sunk very far into his head. He<cb n="708.38.1"/><pb n="38"/> seemed exhausted by his perplexities, languid with disappointment; but when the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">sentry</rs> on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">landing</placeName> thrust his head in to announce the arrival of a prisoner he revived at once. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Let him be brought in,"</said> he shouted, fiercely. The door flew open, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, bareheaded, his waistcoat open, the bow of his tie under his ear, was hustled into the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName>.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> recognised him at once. He could not have hoped for a more precious capture; here was a man who could tell him, if he chose, everything he wished to know -- and directly the problem of how best to make him talk to the point presented itself to his mind. The resentment of a foreign nation had no terrors for <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>. The might of a whole armed <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Europe">Europe</placeName> would not have protected <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> from insults and ill-usage so well as the quick reflection of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> that this was an Englishman who would most likely turn obstinate under bad treatment, and become quite unmanageable. At all events, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs> smoothed the scowl on his brow. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"What! The excellent <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Señor Mitchell</rs>!"</said> he cried, in affected dismay. The pretended anger of his swift advance and of his shout, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Release the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">caballero</rs> at once,"</said> was so effective that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">astounded soldiers</rs> positively sprang away from <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">their prisoner <!-- "their" refers to Sotillo's men --></rs>. Thus suddenly deprived of forcible support, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> reeled as though about to fall. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> took him familiarly under the arm, led him to a chair, waved his hand at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName>: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Go out, all of you,"</said> he commanded.</p> 
            <p>When they had been left alone he stood looking down, irresolute and silent, waiting till <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> had recovered his power of speech.</p>
            <p>Here in his very grasp was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">one of the men concerned in the removal of the silver</rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>'s temperament was of that sort that he experienced a violent desire to beat him; just as formerly when negotiating with difficulty a loan from the cautious <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Anzani">Anzani</rs>, his fingers always itched to take the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Anzani">shopkeeper</rs> by the throat. As to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, the suddenness, unexpectedness; and general inconceivableness of this experience had confused his thoughts. Moreover, he was physically out of breath.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"I've been knocked down three times between this and the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName>,"</said> he gasped out at last. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Somebody shall be made to pay for this."</said> He had certainly stumbled more than once and had been dragged along for some distance before he could regain his stride. With his recovered breath his indignation seemed to madden him. He jumped up crimson, all his white hair bristling,his eyes glaring vengefully, and shook violently the flaps of his ruined waistcoat before the disconcerted <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Look! Those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">uniformed thieves of yours</rs> <placeName ref="custom">downstairs</placeName> have robbed me of my watch."</said></p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">old sailor</rs>'s aspect was very threatening. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> saw himself cut off from the table on which his sabre and revolver were lying.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"I demand restitution and apologies,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Mitchell</rs> thundered at him, quite beside himself. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"From you! Yes, from you!"</said></p> 
            <p>For the space of a second or so the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs> stood with a perfectly stony expression of face; then, as <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> flung out an arm towards the table as if to snatch up the revolver <cb n="708.38.2"/>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, with a yell of alarm, bounded to the door and was gone in a flash, slamming it after him. Surprise calmed <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>'s fury. Behind the closed door <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> shouted on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">landing</placeName>, and there was a great tumult of feet on the wooden staircase. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Disarm him! Bind him!"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs> could be heard screaming. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> had just the time to glance at the windows, with three perpendicular bars of iron each and some twenty feet from the ground, as he well knew, before the door flew open and the rush upon him took place. In an incredibly short space of time he found himself bound with many turns of a hide rope to a high-backed chair, so that his head alone remained free. Not till then did <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, who had been leaning in the doorway trembling visibly, venture again within. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">soldiers</rs>, picking up from the floor the rifles they had dropped to grapple with the prisoner, filed out of the room. The officers remained leaning on their swords and looking on.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"The watch, the watch,"</said> raved the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs>, pacing to and fro like a tiger in a cage. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Give me that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">man</rs>'s watch."</said> It was true that when searched for arms in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">hall downstairs</placeName> before being taken into <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>'s presence, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> had been relieved of his watch and chain, but at the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs>'s clamour it was produced quickly enough, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">a corporal</rs> bringing it up carried carefully in the palms of his joined hands. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> snatched it and pushed the clenched fist from which it dangled close to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>'s face.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Now then! You <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">arrogant Englishman</rs>! You dare to call the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">soldiers of the army</rs> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">thieves</rs>! Behold your watch."</said> He flourished his fist as if aiming blows at the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">prisoner</rs>'s nose. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, helpless as a swathed infant, looked anxiously at the sixty guinea gold half-chronometer, presented to him years ago by a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#underwriters">Committee of Underwriters</rs> for saving a ship from total loss by fire. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, too, seemed to perceive its valuable appearance. He stepped aside to the table and began a careful examination in the light of the candles. He had never seen anything so fine. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">His officers</rs> closed in and craned their necks behind his back.</p> 
            <p>He became so interested that for an instant he forgot <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">his precious prisoner</rs>. There is always something childish in the rapacity of the passionate, clear minded, Southern races wanting in the misty idealism of the Northerners, who at the smallest encouragement dream of nothing less than the conquest of the earth. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> was fond of jewels, gold trinkets, of personal adornment. After a moment he turned about, and with a commanding gesture of his hand made all his officers fall back. He laid down the watch on the table, then, negligently, pushed his hat over it.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Ha!"</said> he began, going up very close to the chair <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"You dare call my valiant soldiers of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Esmeralda">Esmeralda</placeName> regiment, thieves. You dare! What impudence! You foreigners come here to rob our country of its wealth. You never have enough! Your audacity knows no bounds."</said></p> 
            <p>He looked towards the officers, amongst whom there was an approving murmur. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">old adjutant-major</rs> was moved to declare, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">"Si, mi <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs>. They are all traitors."<cb n="708.38.3"/></said></p>  
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"I shall say nothing,"</said> continued <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, fixing the motionless and powerless <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Mitchell</rs> with an angry but uneasy stare. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"I shall say nothing of your treacherous attempt to get possession of my revolver to shoot me while I was trying to treat you with a consideration you did not deserve. You have forfeited your life. Your only hope is in my clemency."</said></p> 
            <p>He watched for the effect of his words, but there was no obvious sign of fear on <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>'s face. His white hair was full of dust, which covered also the rest of his helpless person. As if he had heard nothing, he twitched an eyebrow to get rid of a bit of straw which hung amongst the hairs.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> advanced one leg and put his arms akimbo.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"It is you, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Mitchell</rs>,"</said> he said emphatically, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"who are the thief, not <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">my soldiers</rs>."</said> He pointed at <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">his prisoner</rs> a forefinger, with a long, almond-shaped nail. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Where is the silver of the <placeName ref="SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName>? I ask you <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Mitchell</rs>, where is the silver that was deposited in this <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Custom House</placeName>? Answer me that! You stole it. Yon were a party to stealing it. It is stolen from the Government. Aha! you think I do not know what I say, but I am up to your foreign tricks. It is gone, the silver. No? Gone in one of your lanchas, you <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">miserable man</rs>. How dared you?"</said></p> 
            <p>This time he produced his effect. How on earth could <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> know that? thought <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Mitchell</rs>. His head, the only part of his body that could move, betrayed his surprise by a sudden jerk.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Ha! you tremble,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> shouted suddenly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"It is a conspiracy. It is a crime against the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">State</placeName>. Did you not know that the silver belongs to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Republic</placeName> till the Government claims are satisfied? Where is it? Where have you hidden it, you <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">miserable thief</rs>?"</said></p> 
            <p>At this question <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>'s sinking spirits revived. In whatever incomprehensible manner <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> had already got his information about the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</placeName>, he had not captured it. That was clear. In his outraged heart, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> had resolved that nothing would induce him to say a word while he remained so disgracefully bound, but his desire to help the escape of the silver made him depart from this resolution. His wits were very much at work. He detected in <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> a certain air of doubt, of irresolution. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"That <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">man</rs>,"</said> he said to himself, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"is not certain of what he advances."</said> For all his pomposity in social intercourse, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> could meet the realities of life in a resolute and ready spirit. Now he had got over the first shock of the abominable treatment he was cool and collected enough. The immense contempt he felt for <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> steadied him, and he said oracularly, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"No doubt it is well concealed by this time."</said></p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, too, had time to cool down. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"My bien <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Mitchell</rs>,"</said> he said in a cold and threatening manner. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"But can you produce the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Government</placeName> receipt for the royalty and the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Custom House</placeName> permit of embarcation, hey ? Can you? No. Then the silver has been removed illegally, and the guilty shall be made to suffer, unless it is produced within five days from this."</said></p><pb/>

            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel Sotillo</rs> gave orders for the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">prisoner</rs> to be unbound and locked up in one of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">smaller rooms downstairs</placeName>. He walked about the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName>, moody and silent, till <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, with each of his arms held by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">a couple of men</rs>, stood up, shook himself and stamped his feet.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"How did you like to be tied up, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Mitchell</rs>?"</said> he asked derisively.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"It is the most incredible, abominable use of power,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> declared in a loud voice. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"And whatever your purpose, you shall gain nothing from it, I can promise you."</said></p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">tall colonel</rs>, livid, with his coal-black ringlets and moustache, crouched as it were, to look into the eyes of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">short, thick-set, red-faced prisoner</rs>, with rumpled hair.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"That we shall see. You shall know my power a little better when I tie you up to a potalon outside in the sun for a whole day."</said></p> 
            <p>He drew himself up haughtily, and made a sign for <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> to be led away.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"What about my watch?"</said> cried <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, hanging back from the efforts of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">men</rs> pulling him towards the door.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> turned to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">his officers</rs>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"No! But only listen to this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">picaro</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">caballeros</rs>,"</said> he pronounced with affected scorn, and was answered by a chorus of derisive laughter. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"He demands his watch!"</said>... He ran up again to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, for the desire to relieve his feelings by inflicting blows and pain upon <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">this Englishman</rs> was very strong within him. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Your watch! You are a prisoner in war time <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Mitchell</rs>! In war time! You have no rights and no property. Caramba!

            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Bosh,"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, concealing a disagreeable impression.</p>

        <div type ="chapter" n="3.3.69">
            <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
            <p>Down below in a great <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">hall</placeName>, with the earthen floor and with a tall mound thrown up by white ants in a corner, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">soldiers</rs> had kindled a small fire with broken chairs and tables, near the arched <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">gateway</placeName> through which the faint murmur of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> waters on the beach could be heard. While <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> was being led down the staircase, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">an officer</rs> passed him running up to report to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> the capture of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloPrisoners">some prisoners</rs>. A Lot of smoke hung about in the vast gloomy place, the fire crackled, and, as if through a haze, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> made out, surrounded<cb n="715.69.2"/> by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">short soldiers</rs> with fixed bayonets, the heads of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloPrisoners  serOgraphies.xml#Monygham serOgraphies.xml#EIC serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">three tall prisoners</rs>: the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer-in-Chief</rs>, and the white leonine mane of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Viola</rs>, who stood half turned away from the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#">others</rs> with his chin on his breast and his arms crossed. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Mitchell</rs>'s astonishment knew no bounds. He cried out, the other two exclaimed also. But he was hurried on, diagonally, across the big cavern-like hall. Lots of thoughts, surmises, hints of caution, and so on, crowded his head to distraction.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"Is he actually keeping you?"</said> shouted the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Chief Engineer</rs>, whose single eyeglass glittered in the firelight. An <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">officer</rs> from the top of the stairs was shouting urgently. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">"Bring them all up. All three."</said> In the clamour of voices and the rattle or arms, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> made himself heard imperfectly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"By heavens! the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">fellow</rs> has stolen my watch!"</said></p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer-in-Chief</rs> on the staircase resisted the pressure long enough to shout <said who="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">"What? What did you say?"</said>></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"My chronometer!"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> yelled violently at the very moment of being thrust head foremost through a small door into a sort of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">cell</placeName>, perfectly black, and so narrow that he fetched up against the opposite wall.  The door had been instantly slammed. He knew where they had put him. This was the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">strong room</placeName> of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Custom House</placeName> whence the silver had been removed only a few hours earlier. It was almost as narrow as a corridor, with a small square aperture barred by a heavy grating at the distant end. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> staggered for a few steps, then sat down on the earthen floor with his back to the wall. Nothing, not even a gleam of light from anywhere, interfered with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>'s meditation. He did some hard but not very extensive thinking. It was not of a gloomy cast. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">old sailor</rs>, with all his small weaknesses and absurdities, was constitutionally incapable of entertaining for any length of time a fear of his personal safety. It was not so much firmness of soul as the lack of a certain kind of imagination; the kind whose undue development caused intense suffering to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Señor Hirsch</rs>; that sort of imagination which adds the blind terror of bodily suffering and of death, envisaged as an accident to the body alone, strictly -- to all the other apprehensions on which the sense of one's existence is based. Unfortunately, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> had not much penetration of any kind; characteristic, illuminating trifles of expression, action or movement, escaped him completely. He was too pompously and innocently aware of his own existence to observe that of others. For instance, he could<cb n="715.69.3"/> not believe that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> had been really afraid of him, and this simply because it would never have entered into his head to shoot anyone except in the most pressing case of self-defense. Anybody could see he was not a murdering kind of man, he reflected quite gravely. But his thoughts mainly  clung around the astounding and unanswerable question: How the devil the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">fellow</rs> got to know that the silver had gone off in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</placeName>? It was obvious that he had not captured it. And, obviously, he could not have captured it! In this last conclusion <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> was misled by the assumption drawn from his observation of the weather during his long vigil on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName>. He thought that there had been much more wind that usual that night in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">gulf</placeName>; whereas, as a matter of fact, the reverse was the case.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"How in the name of all that's marvellous that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">confounded fellow</rs> got wind of the affair," </said>was the first question he asked directly after the bang, clatter, and flash of the open door (which was closed again almost before he could lift his dropped head) informed him that he had a companion of captivity. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>'s voice stopped muttering curses in English and Spanish.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Is that you <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Mitchell?"</rs></said> he made answer surlily. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I struck my forehead against this confounded wall with enough force to fell an ox. Where are you?"</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, accustomed to the darkness could make out the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> stretching out his hand blindly.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"I am sitting here on the floor. Don't fall over my legs,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>'s voice announced with great dignity of tone. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, entreated not to walk about in the dark, sank down to the ground too. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotilloprisoners serOgraphies.xml#Monygham serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">two prisoners of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs></rs>, with their heads nearly touching, began to exchange confidences.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Yes,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> related in a low tone to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>'s vehement questions, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"We have been nabbed in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">old Viola's place</placeName>. It seems that one of their pickets, commanded by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">an officer</rs>, pushed as far as the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town gate</placeName>. They had orders not to enter, but to bring along every soul they could find on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plain">plain</placeName>. We had been talking in there with the door open, and no doubt they saw the glimmer of our light. They must have been making their approaches for some time. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer</rs> laid himself on a bench in a recess by the fireplace, and I went upstairs to have a look. I hadn't heard any sound from there for a long time. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Old Viola </rs>,<pb n="70"/> as soon as he saw me come up, lifted his arm for silence. I stole in on tip-toe. By Jove, his <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">wife</rs> was laying down and had gone to sleep. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">woman</rs> had actually dropped off to sleep! <said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">'<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Señor doctor</rs>'</said>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Viola</rs> whispers to me, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Viola">'It looks as if her oppression were going to get better.'</said> <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">'Yes,'</said> I said, very much surprised, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">'<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">Your wife</rs> is a wonderful woman, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Giorgio</rs>.'</said> Just then a shot was fired in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">kitchen</placeName>, which made us jump and cower, as if at a thunder clap. It seems that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">party of soldiers</rs> had stolen quite close up and one of them had crept up to the door. He looked in, thought there was no one there, and holding his rifle ready, entered quietly. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">chief</rs> told me that he had just closed his eyes for a moment. When he opened them, he saw the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">man</rs> already in the middle of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">room</placeName> peering into the dark corners. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">chief</rs> was so startled that, without thinking, he made one leap from the recess right out in front of the fireplace. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">soldier</rs>, no less startled, up with his rifle and pulled the trigger, deafening and singeing the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">engineer</rs>, but in his flurry missing him completely. But, look what happens! At the noise of the report the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">sleeping woman</rs> sat up, as if moved by a spring, with a shriek, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">'The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">children</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Gian' Battista</rs>! Save the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">children</rs>.'</said> I have it in my ears now. It was the truest cry of distress I ever heard. I stood as if paralysed, but the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old husband</rs> ran across to the bedside stretching out his hands. She clung to them. I could see her eyes go glazed; the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old fellow</rs> lowered her down on the pillows and then looked round at me. She was dead. All this took less than two minutes, and then I ran down to see what was the matter. It was no use thinking of any resistance. Nothing we two could say availed with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">officer</rs>, so I volunteered to go up with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">a couple of soldiers</rs> and fetch down <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Viola</rs>. He was sitting at the foot of the bed looking at his <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Theresa">wife</rs>'s face, and did not seem to hear what I said; but after I had pulled the sheet over her face, he got up and followed us <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">downstairs</placeName> quietly in a sort of thoughtful way. They marched us off along the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Calle">road</placeName>, leaving the door open and the candle burning. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Chief Engineer</rs> strode on without a word, but I looked back once or twice at the feeble gleam. After we had gone some considerable distance, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Garibaldino</rs>, who was walking by my side, suddenly said: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">'I have buried many men on battlefields on this continent. The priests talk of consecrated ground! Bah! All the earth made by God is holy; but the sea, which knows nothing of kings and priests and tyrants, is the holiest of all. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> I should like to bury her in the sea. No mummeries, candles, incense, no holy water mumbled over by priests. The spirit of liberty is upon the waters.'</said> . . . Amazing <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old man</rs>. He was saying all this in an undertone as if talking to himself."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Yes, yes,"</said> interrupted <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> impatiently. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Poor old chap</rs>. But have you any idea how that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">ruffian Sotillo</rs> obtained his information. He did not get hold of any of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">our Cargadores</rs> who helped with the truck, did he? But no, it is impossible! These were <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">picked men</rs> we've had in our boats for these five years, and I paid them myself specially for the job<cb n="715.70.2"/> with instructions to keep out of the way for twenty-four hours at least. I saw them with my own eyes march off with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Italians">Italians</rs> to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway yards</placeName>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">chief</rs> promised to give them rations as long as they wanted to remain there."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Well,"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> slowly, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I can tell you that you may say good-bye for ever to your best <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</placeName>, and to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">Cargadores</rs></rs>."</said></p> 
            <p>At this, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> scrambled up to his feet in the excess of his excitement. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, without giving him time to exclaim, stated briefly the part played by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Hirsch</rs> during the night.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> was overcome. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Drowned,"</said> he muttered in a bewildered and appalled whisper. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Drowned!"</said> Afterwards he kept still, apparently listening, but too absorbed in the news of the catastrophe to follow the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>'s narrative with attention.</p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> had, he said, taken up an attitude of perfect ignorance, till at last <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> was induced to have <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Hirsch</rs> brought in to repeat the whole story, which was got out of him again with the greatest difficulty, because every moment he would break out into lamentations. At last, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Hirsch</rs> was led away looking more dead than alive, and shut up in one of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">upstair rooms</placeName> to be close at hand. Then the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, keeping up his character of a man not admitted to the inner councils of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeAdmin">Administration</rs>, remarked that the story sounded incredible. Of course, he said, he couldn't tell what had been the action of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CostaguanaEuropeans">Europeans</rs>, as he had been exclusively occupied with his own work in looking after the wounded, and also in attending <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosJose">Don Jose Avellanos</rs>. He had succeeded in assuming so well a tone of impartial indifference, that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> seemed to be completely deceived. Till then a show of regular inquiry had been kept up; <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">one of the officers</rs> sitting at the table wrote down the questions and the answers, the others lounging about the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName>, listened attentively, puffing at their long cigars and keeping their eyes on the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>. But at that point <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> ordered everybody out.</p> 
            <p>Directly they were alone, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs>'s severe official manner changed. He rose and approached the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>. His eyes shone with rapacity and hope; he became confidential. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"The silver might have been indeed put on board the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</placeName>, but it was not conceivable that it should have been taken out to sea."</said> The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, watching every word, nodded slightly, smoking with apparent relish the cigar which <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> had offered him as a sign of his friendly intentions. His manner of cold detachment from the rest of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CostaguanaEuropeans">Europeans</rs> led <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> on, till from conjecture to conjecture, he arrived at hinting that in his opinion this was a put-up job on the part of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, in order to get hold of that immense, treasure all to himself. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, observant and self-possessed as to mutter, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"He is very capable of that."</said></p> 
            <p>Here <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> exclaimed with amazement, amusement, and indignation. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"You said that of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>."</said> Disgust, and even some suspicion crept into his tone, for to him too, as to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CostaguanaEuropeans">other Europeans <!-- Europeans other than Mitchell --> </rs>, there appeared to be something dubious about the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>'s personality.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"What on earth made you say that to that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">watch-stealing scoundrel</rs>,"</said> he asked. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"What's the object of an infernal lie of that sort? That <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">confounded pickpocket</rs> was quite capable of believing you."</said></p> 
            <p>He snorted. For a time the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> remained silent in the dark.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Yes, that is exactly what I did say,"</said> he uttered at last in a tone which would have made it clear enough to a third party that the pause was not of a reluctant but of a reflective character. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> thought that he had never heard anything so brazenly impudent in his life.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">" Well, well!"</said> he muttered to himself, but he had not the heart to voice his thoughts. They were swept away by others full of astonishment and regret. A heavy sense of discomfiture crushed him: the loss of the silver, the death of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, which was really quite a blow to his sensibilities because he had become attached to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">his Capataz</rs> as people get attached to their inferiors from love of ease and almost unconscious gratitude. And when he thought of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs> being drowned too, his sensibility was almost overcome by his miserable end. What a heavy blow for that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">poor young woman</rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> did not belong to the species of crabbed old bachelors; on the contrary, he liked to see young men paying attentions to young women. It seemed to him a natural and proper thing. Proper especially. As to sailors, it was different; it was not their place to marry, he maintained, but it was on moral grounds as a matter of self-denial, for, he explained, life on board ship is not fit for a woman even at best, and if you leave her on shore, first of all it is not fair, and next she either suffers from it or doesn't care a bit, which, in both cases, is bad. He couldn't have told what upset him most, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>'s immense material loss, the death of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, which was a heavy loss to himself, or the idea of that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">beautiful and accomplished young woman</rs> being plunged into mourning.</p>

            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"But this is perfectly imbecile,"</said> cried <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>.</p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> remarked that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> <emph>was</emph> imbecile, and that his imbecility was ingenious enough to lead him completely astray. He had helped him only but a little way.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I mentioned,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> said, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"in a sort of casual way that treasure is generally buried in the earth rather than being set afloat upon the sea. At this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">my Sotillo <!-- "my" refers to Monygham --></rs> slapped his forehead. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">'Por Dios, yes,'</said> he said, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">'they must have buried it on the shores of this <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> somewhere before they sailed out.'</said></said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Heavens and earth!"</said> muttered <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"I should not have believed that anybody could be ass enough --"</said> He paused, then went on mournfully, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"But what's the good of all this? It would have been a clever enough lie if the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</placeName> had been still afloat. It would have kept that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">inconceivable idiot</rs> perhaps from sending out the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloShip">steamer</placeName> to cruise in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">gulf</placeName>. That was the danger that worried me no end."</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> sighed profoundly.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I had an object,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> pronounced slowly.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Had you?"</said> muttered <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Well, that is lucky, or else I would have thought that you went on fooling him for the fun of the thing. Blackening a friend's character is not my idea of fun, if it were to fool the greatest blackguard on earth."</said></p>
            <p>Had it not been for <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>'s depression, caused by the fatal news, his disgust of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> would have taken a more outspoken shape.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"I wonder,"</said> he grumbled, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"why they have shut us up together, or why <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> should have shut you up at all, since it seems to me you have been fairly chummy up there?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Yes, I wonder?"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> grimly.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>'s heart was so heavy that he would have preferred for the time being a complete solitude to the best of company. But any company would have been preferable to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>'s at whom he had always looked askance as a sort of beachcomber of superior intelligence partly reclaimed form his abased state. That feeling led him to ask, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"What has the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">ruffian</rs> done with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">other two</rs>?"</said></p><cb n="722.101.2"/>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Chief Engineer</rs> he would have let go in any case,"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"He wouldn't like to have quarrel with the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway</placeName> upon his hands. Not just yet, at any rate. I don't think. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, that you understand exactly what <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>'s position is -- "</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"I don't see why I should bother my head about it,"</said> snarled <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"No,"</said> assented the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, with the same grim composure. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I don't see why you should. It wouldn't help a single human being in the world if you thought ever so hard upon any subject whatever."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"No"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, simply.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"As to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Viola</rs>"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> continued as though he had not heard, <said>"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> released him for the same reason he is presently going to release you."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Eh? What?"</said> exclaimed <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, staring like an owl in the darkness. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"What is there in common between me and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Viola</rs>? More likely because the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old chap</rs> has no watch and chain for the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">pickpocket</rs> to steal. And I tell you what, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>,"</said> he went on, with rising choler, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"he will find it more difficult than he thinks to get rid of me. He will burn his fingers over that job yet, I can tell you. To begin with, I won't go without my watch, and as to the rest -- we shall see. I am a public character, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">sir</rs>."</said></p>
            <p>And then <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> became aware that the bars of the opening had become visible; a black grating upon a square of grey. The coming of the day silenced <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> as if by the reflection that now in all the future days he would be deprived of the invaluable services of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">his Capataz</rs>. He leaned against the wall with his arms folded on his breast, and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> walked up and down the whole length of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#customPrison">place</placeName> with his peculiar hobbling gait, as if slinking on damaged feet. When the door of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#customPrison">prison</placeName> was suddenly flung open he showed no surprise. He swerved sharply in his walk, and passed out at once, as though much depended upon his speed; but <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> remained for some time with his shoulders against the wall, quite undecided in the bitterness of his spirit whether it wouldn't be better to refuse to stir a limb in the way of protest. He had half a mind to get himself carried out, but after the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">officer at the door</rs> had shouted three or four times in tones of remonstrance and surprise he condescended to walk out.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>'s manner had changed. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs>'s off-hand civility was slightly irresolute, as though he were in doubt if civility was slightly irresolute, as though he were in doubt if civility were the proper course in this case.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"I have concluded not to detain you,<cb n="722.101.3"/> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Señor Mitchell</rs>. I am of a forgiving disposition. I make allowances. Let this be a lesson to you, however."</said></p>
            <p>The peculiar dawn of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>, which seems to break far away to the westward and creep back into the shade of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Higuerota">mountains</placeName>, mingled with the reddish light of the candles. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, in sign of contempt and indifference let his eyes roam all over the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#customPrison">room</placeName>, and he gave a hard stare to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, perched already on the casement of one of the windows, with his eyelids lowered, careless and thoughtful -- or perhaps ashamed.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, ensconced in the vast armchair, remarked:</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"I should have thought that the feelings of a caballero would have dictated to you an appropriate reply."</said></p>
            <p>He waited for it, but <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> remaining mute, more from extreme resentment than from reasoned intention, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> hesitated, glanced towards the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, who looked up and nodded, then went on with a slight effort.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Here, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Señor Mitchell</rs>, is your watch. Learn how hasty and unjust has been your judgment of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">my patriotic soldiers</rs>."</said></p>
            <p>Lying back in his seat, he extended his arm over the table and pushed the watch away slightly. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> walked up with undisguised eagerness, put it to his ear, then slipped it into his pocket coolly.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> seemed to overcome an immense reluctance. Again he looked aside at the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, who stared at him unwinkingly.</p>
            <p>But as <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> was turning away, without as much as a nod or a glance, he hastened to say, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"You may go and wait <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">downstairs</placeName> for the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Señor Doctor</rs>, whom I am going to liberate, too. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#foreigners serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">You foreigners</rs> are insignificant, to my mind."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"The law shall take note later on of your transgressions,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> hurried on. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"But as for me, you can live free, unguarded, unobserved. Do you hear, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Señor Mitchell</rs>? You may depart to your affairs. You are beneath my notice. My attention is claimed by matters of the very highest importance."</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> was very nearly provoked to an answer. It displeased him to be liberated insultingly but want of sleep, prolonged anxieties, a profound disappointment with the fatal ending of the silver-saving business weighed upon his spirits. It occurred to him distinctly that something underhand was going on. As he went out he ignored the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> pointedly.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"A brute,"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, as the door shut.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> slipped off the windowsill, and, thrusting his hands into the pockets of the long grey dust coat he was wearing, made a few steps into the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#customPrison">room</placeName><!--A period is missing--></p><cb n="722.102.1"/><pb n="102"/>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"So <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonyghamCountryMen">your countrymen <!-- "your" refers to Monygham --></rs> do not confide in you very much, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Señor Doctor</rs>. They do not love you, eh? Why is that, I wonder?"</said></p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, lifting his head, answered by a long, lifeless stare and the words: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Perhaps because I have lived too long in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName>."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Aha! But you love yourself,"</said> he said encouragingly.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"If you leave them alone,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> said, looking with the same lifeless stare at <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>'s handsome face, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"they will betray themselves very soon. Meantime I may try to make <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs> speak?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Ah! <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Señor Doctor</rs>,"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, wagging his head, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"you are a man of quick intelligence. We were made to understand each other."</said> He turned away. He could bear no longer that expressionless and motionless stare, which semed <!--sic--> to have a sort of impenetrable emptiness like the black depth of an abyss.</p>
            <p>Even in a man utterly devoid of moral sense there remains an appreciation of rascality  which, being conventional, is perfectly clear. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> thought that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> so different from all Europeans, was ready to sell <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonyghamCountryMen">his countrymen</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">his employer</rs>, for some share of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé</placeName> silver. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> did not despise him for that. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs>'s want of moral sense was of a profound and innocent character. It bordered upon stupidity, moral stupidity. Nothing that served his ends could appear to him really reprehensible. Nevertheless, he despised <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>. He had for him an immense and satisfactory contempt. He despised him with all his heart because he did not mean to let the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> have any reward at all. He despised him, not as a man without faith and honour, but as a fool. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>'s insight into his character had deceived <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> completely. Therefore he thought the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> a fool.</p>
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="3.4.102">
            <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
            <p>Since his arrival in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs>'s ideas had undergone some modification.</p>
            <p>He no longer wished for a political career in <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">Montero</rs>'s administration. He had always doubted the safety of that course; since he had learned from the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Chief Engineer</rs> that at daylight most likely he would be confronted by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedro Montero</rs> his misgivings on that point had considerably increased. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">guerillero brother of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">General</rs></rs> -- the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito of popular speech</rs> -- had a reputation of his own. He wasn't safe to deal with. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> had vaguely planned of seizing not only the treasure but the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> itself, and then negotiating at leisure. But in the face of the facts learned from the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Chief Engineer</rs> (who had frankly disclosed to him the whole situation) his audacity, never of a very dashing kind, had been replaced by a most cautious hesitation.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"An army -- an army crossed the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Higuerota">mountains</placeName> under <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs> already,"</said> he had repeated, unable to hide his consternation. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"If it had not been that I am given the news by a man of your position I would never have believed it. Astonishing."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgarphies.xml#EIC">"An armed force,"</said> corrected the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer</rs> suavely.</p>
            <p>His aim was attained. It was to keep <cb n="722.102.2"/> the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> clear of any armed occupation for a few hours longer, to let those whom fear impelled leave the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>. In the general dismay there were families hopeful enough to fly upon the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#LosHatosRoad">road towards <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#LosHatos">Los Hatos</placeName></placeName>, which was left open by the withdrawal of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard">armed rabble under <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Señores Fuentes</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs></rs>, to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Rincon">Rincon</placeName>, with their enthusiastic welcome for <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedro Montero</rs>. It was a hasty and risky exodus, and it was said that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs>, occupying with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#HernandezMen">his band</rs> the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#LosHatos">woods around <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#LosHatos">Los Hatos</placeName></placeName>, was receiving the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#fugitivesToHernandez">fugitives</rs>.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">Father Corbelàn</rs>'s efforts in the cause of that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">most pious robber</rs> had not been altogether fruitless. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#polititcalChiefOfSulaco">political chief of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName></rs> had yielded at the last moment to the urgent entreaties of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">priest</rs>, had signed a provisional nomination appointing <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs> a general, and calling upon him officially in this new capacity to preserve order in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>. The fact is that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#politicalChiefOfSulaco">political chief</rs>, seeing the situation desperate, did not care what he signed. It was the last official document he signed before he left the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">palace of the Intendencia</placeName> for the refuge of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN">O.S.N. Company's office</placeName>. But even had he meant his act to be effective it was already too late. The riot which he feared and expected broke out in less than an hour after <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">Father Corbelàn</rs>, who had appointed a meeting with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#DominicanConvent">Dominican Convent</placeName> where he had <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#DominicanConvent">his residence in one of the cells<!-- "his" refers to Father Corbelàn --></placeName>, never managed to reach the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#DominicanConvent">place</placeName>. From the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">Intendencia</placeName> he had gone straight on to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosHouse">Avellanos</rs>'s house to tell <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosJose">his brother-in-law</rs>, and though he stayed there no more than half an hour he had found himself cut off from <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DominicanConvent">his ascetic abode <!-- "his" refers to Father Corbelàn --></rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, after waiting there for some time watching uneasily the increasing uproar in the quiet street, had made his way to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Porvenir">offices of the "Porvenir,"</placeName> and stayed there till daylight, as <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs> had mentioned in the letter to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudSister">his sister</rs>. Thus the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>, instead of riding towards the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#LosHatos"><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#LosHatos">Los Hatos</placeName> woods</placeName> as bearer of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs>'s nomination, had remained in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> to save the life of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ribiera">President-Dictator</rs>, to assist in repressing the outbreak of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">mob</rs>, and at last to sail out with the silver of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName>.</p>
            <p>But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">Father Corbelàn</rs>, escaping to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs>, had the document in his pocket, a piece of official writing turning a bandit into a general in a memorable last official act of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ribierist">Ribierist party</rs>, whose watchwords were honesty, peace, and progress. Probably neither the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">priest</rs> nor the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">bandit</rs> saw the irony of it. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">Father Corbelàn</rs> must have found messengers to send into the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>, for early on the second day of disturbances there were rumours of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs> being on the road to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#LosHatos">Los Hatos</placeName> ready to receive those who would put themselves under his protection. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman" >A strange-looking horseman</rs>, elderly and audacious, had appeared in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>, riding slowly while his eyes examined the fronts of the houses as though he had never seen such high buildings before. Before the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#cathedral">Cathedral</placeName> he had dismounted, and, kneeling in the middle of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">Plaza</placeName>, his bridle over the arm, and his hat lying in front of him on the ground, had bowed his head, crossing himself, and beating his breast for some little time. Remounting his <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorsemanHorse">horse</rs>, with a fearless, but not unfriendly, look round the little gathering formed about his public devo<cb n="722.102.3"/>tions, he had asked for the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosHouse">Casa Avellanos</placeName>. A score of hands were extended in answer, with fingers pointing up the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Calle">Calle de la Constitucion</placeName>.</p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">horseman</rs> had gone on with only a glance of casual curiosity upwards to the windows of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">Amarilla Club</placeName> at the corner. His stentorian voice shouted periodically in the empty street: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">"Which is the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosHouse">Casa Avellanos</placeName>?"</said> till an answer came from the <rs ref="serOgrapahies.xml#AvellanosHousePorter">scared porter</rs>, and he disappeared under the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosHouse">gate</placeName>. The letter he was bringing, written by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">Father Corbelàn</rs> with a pencil by the camp fire of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs>, was addressed to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosJose">Don José</rs>, of whose critical state the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">priest</rs> was not aware. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs> read it, and, after consulting with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, sent it on for the information of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AmarillaMen">gentlemen garrisoning the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">Amarilla Club</placeName></rs>. For herself, her mind was made up; she would rejoin <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">her uncle</rs>; she would entrust the last day -- the last hours perhaps -- of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosJose">her father</rs>'s life to the keeping of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">bandit</rs>, whose existence was a protest against the irresponsible tyranny of all parties alike; against the moral darkness of the land. The gloom of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#LosHatos"><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#LosHatos">Los Hatos</placeName> woods</placeName> was preferable; a life of hardships in the train of a robber band less debasing. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs> embraced with all her soul <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">her uncle</rs>'s obstinate defiance of misfortune. It was grounded in the belief in the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">man whom she loved</rs>.</p>
            <p>In his message the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">Vicar-General</rs> answered upon his head for <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs>'s fidelity. As to his power, he pointed out that he had remained unsubdued for so many years. In that letter <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>'s idea of the new Occidental State (whose flourishing and stable condition is a matter of common knowledge now) was for the first time made public and used as an argument. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">ex-bandit</rs> and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">last general of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ribierist">Ribierist</rs> creation</rs>, was confident of being able to hold the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#LosHatos">tract of country between the woods of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#LosHatos">Los Hatos</placeName> and the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#coastRange">coast range</placeName></placeName> till that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">devoted patriot</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Don Martin Decoud</rs>, could bring <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">General Barrios</rs> back to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> for the re-conquest of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">"Heaven itself wills it. Providence is on our side,"</said> wrote <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">Father Corbelàn</rs>; and there was no time to reflect upon or to controvert his statement; and if the discussion started upon the reading of that letter in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">Amarilla Club</placeName> was violent, it was also short-lived. In the general bewilderment of the collapse some jumped at the idea with joyful astonishment as upon the amazing discovery of a new hope.</p>

        <div type="chapter" n="3.3.133">
            <head>CHAPTER III. (continued)</head>
            <p>All the latter part of the afternoon an animated discussion went on in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">big rooms</placeName> of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">Amarilla Club</placeName>. Even those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AmarillaMembers">members</rs> posted at the windows with rifles and carbines to guard the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Calle">end of the street</placeName> in case of an offensive return of the populace shouted their opinions and arguments over their shoulders. As dusk fell <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#LopezJuste">Don Juste Lopez</rs>, inviting <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AmarillaMen">those caballeros who were of his way <!-- "his" refers to Don Juste Lopez --> of thinking</rs> to follow him, withdrew into the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">corredor</placeName>, where at a little table in the light of two candles he busied himself in composing an address, or rather a solemn declaration to be presented to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs> by a deputation of such <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Assembly">members of Assembly</rs> as had elected to remain in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>. His idea was to propitiate him in order to save the form at least of parliamentary institutions. Seated before a blank sheet of paper, a goose-quill pen in his hand, and surged upon from all sides, he turned to the right and to the left repeating with solemn insistence: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#LopezJuste">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AmarillaMen">Caballeros</rs>, a moment of silence! A moment of silence! We ought to make it clear that we bow in all good faith to the accomplished facts."</said> The utterance of that phrase seemed to give him a melancholy satisfaction.</p>  
            <p>Meantime the exodus had begun. Carretas full of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">ladies</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">children</rs> rolled swaying across the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">Plaza</placeName>, with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">men</rs> walking or riding by their side; <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">mounted parties</rs> followed on <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagersMules">mules</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagersHorses">horses</rs>; the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">poorest</rs> were setting out on foot, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">men</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">women</rs> carrying bundles, clasping <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">babies</rs> in their arms, leading <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">old people</rs>, dragging along the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">bigger children</rs>. When <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, after leaving the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">engineer</rs> at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">Casa Viola</placeName>, entered the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> by the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour"><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> gate</placeName>, all those that had meant to go were gone, and the others had barricaded themselves in their houses. In the whole dark <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Calle">street</placeName> there was only one spot of flickering lights and moving figures, where the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Señor Administrador</rs> recognised <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">his wife</rs>'s carriage waiting at the door of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosHouse">Avellanos's house</placeName>. He rode up, almost unnoticed, and looked on without a word while some of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">his own servants</rs> came out of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosHouse">gate</placeName> carrying <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosJose">Don José Avellanos</rs>, who, with closed eyes and motionless features, appeared perfectly lifeless. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">His wife</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs> walked on each side of the improvised stretcher, which was put at once into the carriage. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">two women</rs> embraced; while from the other side of the landau <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">Father Corbelàn</rs>'s emissary</rs>, with his ragged beard all streaked with grey, and high, bronzed cheek bones, stared, sitting upright in the saddle.<cb n="729.133.2"/> Then <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs>, dry-eyed, got in by the side of the stretcher, and, after making the sign of the cross rapidly, lowered a thick veil upon her face. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">servants</rs> and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosNeighbors">three or four neighbours</rs> who had come to assist stood back, uncovering their heads. On the box, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ignacio">Ignacio</rs> resigned now to driving all night (and to having perhaps his throat cut before daylight), looked back surlily over his shoulder. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">"Drive carefully,"</said> cried <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> in a tremulous voice.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Ignacio">"Si, carefully, si <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">nina</rs>,"</said> he mumbled, chewing his lips, his round leathery cheeks quivering. And the landau rolled slowly out of the light.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"I will see them as far as the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#ford">ford</placeName>,"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">his wife</rs>. She stood on the edge of the side-walk with her hands clasped lightly, and nodded to him as he followed after the carriage. And now the windows of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">Amarilla Club</placeName> were dark. The last spark of resistance had died out. Turning his head at the corner, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> saw <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">his wife</rs> crossing over to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">their own gate</placeName> in the lighted patch of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Calle">street</placeName>. One of their <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldNeighbour">neighbours</rs>, a well-known merchant and landowner of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">province</placeName>, followed at her elbow, talking with great gestures. As she passed in all the lights went out in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Calle">street</placeName>, which remained dark and empty from end to end.</p>
            <p>The houses, of the vast <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">Plaza</placeName> were lost in the night. High up, like a star, there was a small gleam in one of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#cathedral">towers of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#cathedral">Cathedral</placeName></placeName>; and the equestrian statue gleamed pale against the black trees of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Alameda">Alameda</placeName>, like a ghost of royalty haunting the scenes of revolution. The rare prowlers they met ranged themselves against the wall. Beyond the last houses the carriage rolled noiselessly on the soft cushion of dust, and with a greater obscurity a feeling of freshness seemed to fall from the foliage of the trees bordering the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#countryRoad">country road</placeName>. The <rs ref="serOGraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">emissary from <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#HernandezCamp"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs>'s camp</placeName></rs> pushed <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorsemanHorse">his horse</rs> close to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Caballero</rs>,"</said> he said, in an interested voice, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">"you are he whom they call the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">King of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName></rs>, the <rs ref="SerOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">master of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName></rs>? Is it not so?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"Yes, I am the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">master of the mine</rs>,"</said> answered <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>.</p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">man</rs> cantered for a time in silence, then said, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">"I have <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorsemanBrother">a brother</rs>, a sereno in your service in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé valley</placeName>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeOfficials">Your officials</rs> do not oppress the people in the gorge. Doubtless they are afraid of your severity. You are a just man and a powerful one,"</said> he added.</p>
            <p>He spoke in an abrupt, independent tone, but evidently he was communicative with a purpose. He told <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> that he had been a ranchero in one of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lowerValleys">lower valleys, far south</placeName>, a neighbour of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs> in the old days, and godfather to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#HernandezChildren">his eldest boy</rs>; one<cb n="729.133.3"/> of those who joined him in his resistance to the recruiting raid which was the beginning of all their misfortunes. It was he that, when <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">his compadre <!--"his refers to Corbelan's emissary/horseman--></rs> had been carried off for a recruit, had buried <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#HernandezWife">his wife</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#HernandezChildren">children</rs>, murdered by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RibieristSoldiers">soldiers</rs>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">"Si <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">señor</rs>,"</said> he muttered, hoarsely, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">"I and two or three others, the lucky ones left at liberty, buried them all in one grave near the ashes of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#HernandezRanch">their ranch</placeName>, under the tree that had shaded its roof!"</said></p>
            <p>It was to him, too, that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs> came after he had deserted, three years afterwards. He had still his uniform on with the sergeant's stripes on the sleeve, and the blood of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#HernandezColonel">his colonel</rs> upon his hands and breast. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#HernandezFollowers">Three troopers</rs> followed him of those who had started in pursuit, but had ridden on for liberty. And he told <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> how he and a few friends, seeing those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#HernandezFollowers">soldiers</rs>, lay in ambush behind some rocks ready to pull the trigger on them, when he recognised <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">his compadre</rs> and jumped up from cover shouting his name, because he knew that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs> could not have been coming back on an errand of injustice and oppression. Those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#HernandezFollowers">three soldiers</rs>, together with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorsemanParty">party who lay behind the rocks</rs>, had formed the nucleus of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#HernandezMen">famous band</rs>; and he, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">narrator</rs>, had been the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">favourite lieutenant of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs></rs> for many, many years. He mentioned proudly that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ribierist">officials</rs> had put a price upon his head too; but it did not prevent it getting sprinkled with grey upon his shoulders. And now he had lived long enough to see <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">his compadre</rs> made a general.</p>
            <p>He had a burst of muffled laughter. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">"And now from robbers we have become soldiers. But look, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Caballero</rs>, at those who made us soldiers and him a general. Look at these people."</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ignacio">Ignacio</rs> shouted. The light of the carriage lamps, running along the nopal hedges that crowned the bank on each side, flashed upon the scared faces of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoPeople">people</rs> standing aside in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#countryRoad">road</placeName>, sunk deep, like an English country lane, into the soft soil of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Campo">Campo</placeName>. Further on <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ignacio">Ignacio</rs> shouted again to pass a carreta, a long wooden box on two high wheels, with the door at the back swinging open. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoCarretaLadies">Some ladies</rs> in it must have recognised the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldMules">white mules</rs>, because they screamed out, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#CampoCarretaLadies">"Is it you, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Doña Emilia</rs>!"</said></p>
            <p>At the turn of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#countryRoad">road</placeName> the glare of the big fire filled the short stretch vaulted over by the branches meeting overhead. Near the ford of a shallow <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Campo">stream</placeName> a <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRoadSideRanche">roadside ranche</placeName> of woven rushes and a roof of grass had been set on fire by accident, and the flames, roaring viciously, lit up an open space blocked with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRoadSideRancheHorses">horses</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRoadSideRancheMules">mules</rs>, and a distracted, shouting <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRoadSideRancheCrowd">crowd of people</rs>. When <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ignacio">Ignacio</rs> pulled up, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRoadSideRanchoCrowd">several ladies</rs> on foot<cb n="729.134.1"/><pb n="134"/> assailed the carriage, begging <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs> for a seat. To their clamour she answered by pointing silently to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosJose">her father</rs>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"I must leave you here,"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, in the uproar. The flames leaped up sky-high, and in the recoil from the scorching heat across the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#countryRoad">road</placeName> the stream of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRoadSideRancheCrowd">fugitives</rs> pressed against the carriage. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRoadSideRancheWoman">A middle aged lady</rs> dressed in black silk, but with a coarse manta over her head and a rough branch for a stick in her hand, staggered against the front wheel. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRoadSideRancheWomanGirls">Two young girls</rs>, frightened and silent, were clinging to her arms. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> knew her very well.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRoadSideRancheWoman">"Misericordia! We are getting terribly bruised in this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRoadSideRancheCrowd">crowd</rs>!"</said> she exclaimed, smiling up courageously to him. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRoadSideRancheWoman">"We have started on foot. All <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRoadSideRancheWomanServants">our servants</rs> ran away yesterday to join the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#democrats">democrats</rs>. We are going to put ourselves under the protection of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">Father Corbelàn</rs>, of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">your sainted uncle</rs> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs>. He has wrought a miracle in the heart of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">a most merciless robber</rs>. A miracle!"</said></p>
            <p>She raised her voice gradually up to a scream as she was borne along by the pressure of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRaodSideRancheCrowd">people</rs> getting out of the way of some carts coming up out of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#ford">ford</placeName> at a gallop, with loud yells and cracking of whips. Great masses of sparks mingled with black smoke flew over the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#countryRoad">road</placeName>; the bamboos of the walls detonated in the fire with the sound of an irregular fusillade. And then the bright blaze sank suddenly, leaving only a red dusk crowded with aimless dark shadows drifting in contrary directions.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"I must leave you now,"</said> repeated <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs>. She turned her head slowly and uncovered her face. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">emissary</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">compadre of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs></rs> pushed <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorsemanHorse">his horse</rs> close up.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">"Has not the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">master of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName></rs> any message to send to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">master of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Campo">Campo</placeName></rs>?"</said></p>
            <p>The truth of the comparison struck <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> heavily. In his determined purpose he held the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName>, and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">indomitable bandit</rs> held the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Campo">Campo</placeName> by the same precarious tenure. They were equals before the lawlessness of the land. An immense and weary discouragement sealed his lips for a time.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">"You are a just man,"</said> urged the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">emissary of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs></rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">"Look at those people who made <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">my compadre</rs> a general and have turned us all into soldiers. Look at those oligarcas fleeing for life, with only the clothes on their backs. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">My compadre</rs> does not think of that, but <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#HernandezMen">our followers</rs> may be wondering greatly and I would speak for them to you. Look, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">señor</rs>! For many months now the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Campo">Campo</placeName> has been our own. We need ask no man for anything; but soldiers must have their pay to live honestly when the wars are over. It is believed that your soul is so just that a prayer from you would cure the sickness of every beast like the oracion of the upright judge. Let me have some words from your lips that would act like a charm upon the doubts of our <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#HernandezMen">partida</rs>, where all are men."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"Do you hear what he says?"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> said in English to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">"Forgive us our misery!"</said> she exclaimed, hurriedly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">"It is your character that is the inexhaustible treasure which may save us all yet; your character, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Carlos</rs>, not your wealth. I entreat you to give this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanHorseman">man</rs> your word that you will accept any arrangement <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">my uncle</rs><cb n="729.134.2"/> may make with <rs ref="serOGraphies.xml#Hernandez">their chief</rs>. One word. He will want no more."</said></p>
            <p>On the site of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRoadSideRanche">roadside hut</placeName> there remained nothing but an enormous heap of embers, throwing afar a darkening red glow, in which <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs>'s face appeared deeply flushed with excitement. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, with only a short hesitation, pronounced the required pledge. He was like a man who had ventured on a precipitous path with no room to turn. Stoically <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs> lowered her veil, resisting the longing to inquire about <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>'s escape. But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ignacio">Ignacio</rs> leered morosely over his shoulder. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Ignacio">"Take a good look at the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldMules">mules</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">mi amo <!-- "mi" refers to Ignacio" --></rs>,"</said> he grumbled. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Ignacio">"You shall never see them again."</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> turned towards the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>. The jagged peaks of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sierra">Sierra</placeName> came out all black in their clear dawn. The daybreak struggled with the gloom under the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">arcades</placeName> on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">Plaza</placeName>, with no signs of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">country people</rs> disposing their goods for the day's market, with no cheery early morning bustle of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">villagers</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">women</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">children</rs>, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagersdonkeys">loaded donkeys</rs>. Only a few scattered knots of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#revolutionists">revolutionists</rs> stood in the vast space, looking all one way from under their slouched hats for some sign of news from <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Rincon">Rincon</placeName>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#revolutionists">largest of those groups</rs> turned about like one man as <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> passed, and shouted <said who="serOgraphies.xml#revolutionists">"Viva la libertad!"</said> after him in a menacing tone.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> rode on, and turned into the archway of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">his house</placeName>. In the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">patio</placeName> littered with straw, a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#practicante">practicante</rs>, one of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#practicante"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>'s native assistants</rs>, sat on the ground with his back against the rim of the fountain fingering a guitar discreetly, while <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#woundedRelations">two girls of the lower classes</rs> standing up before him shuffled their feet a little and waved their arms, humming a popular dance tune. Most of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#wounded">wounded</rs> during the two days of rioting had been taken away already by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#woundedRelations">their friends</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#woundedRelations">relations</rs>, but <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#wounded">several figures</rs> could be seen sitting up balancing their bandaged heads in time to the music. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> dismounted. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">A sleepy mozo</rs> coming out of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">bakery</placeName> door took hold of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharlesHorse">horse</placeName>'s bridle; the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#practicante">practicante</rs> endeavoured to conceal his guitar hastily; the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#woundedRelations">girls</rs>, unabashed, stepped back smiling, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, on his way to the staircase, glanced into a dark corner of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">patio</placeName> at another group, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#woundedCargador">a mortally wounded cargador</rs> with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#woundedCaragadorWife">a woman</rs> kneeling by his side; she mumbled prayers rapidly, trying at the same time to force a piece of orange between the stiffening lips of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#woundedCargador">dying man</rs>.</p>
            <p>The cruel futility of things stood unveiled in the levity and sufferings of that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguaneros">incorrigible people</rs>; the cruel futility of lives and of deaths thrown away in the vain endeavour to attain an enduring solution of the problem. Unlike <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> could not play lightly a part in a tragic farce. It was tragic enough for him in all conscience, but he could see no farcical element. He suffered too much under a conviction of irremediable folly. He might have known, he said to himself, leaning over the balustrade of the corredor, that Ribierism could never come to anything. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName> had corrupted his judgment by making him sick of bribing and intriguing merely to have  his work left alone from day to day. Like <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHenry">his father</rs>, he did not like to be robbed. It exasperated him. He had persuaded himself that, apart from<cb n="729.134.3"/> higher considerations, the backing up <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosJose">Don José</rs>'s hopes of reform was good business. He had gone forth into the senseless fray like <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldUncle">his poor uncle</rs>, whose sword hung on the wall of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">his study</placeName>, had gone forth -- in the defence of the commonest decencies of organised society. Only his weapon was the wealth of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName>, more far-reaching and subtle than an honest blade of steel. More dangerous to the wielder, too, this weapon of wealth, double-edged with the cupidity and misery of mankind, steeped in all the vices of self-indulgence as in a concoction of poisonous roots, tainting the very cause for which it is drawn, always ready to turn awkwardly in the hand. There was nothing for it now but to go on using it.</p>
            <p>After all, with his English parentage and English up-bringing, he perceived that he was an adventurer in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">descendant of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldLineage">adventurers enlisted in a foreign legion</rs>, of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldLineage">men who had sought fortune in a revolutionary war, who had planned revolutions, who had believed in revolutions</rs></rs>. For all the uprightness of his character, he had something of an adventurer's easy morality which takes count of personal risk in the ethical appraising of his action. He was prepared, if need be, to blow up the whole <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mountain</placeName> sky high out of the territory of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Republic</placeName>.</p>
            <p>Down below in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">patio</placeName> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#woundedCargador">wounded cargador</rs> had breathed his last. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#woundedCargadorWife">woman</rs> cried out once, and her cry, unexpected and shrill, made all the wounded sit up. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#practicante">practicante</rs> scrambled up to his feet, and, guitar in hand, gazed steadily in her direction with elevated eyebrows.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, looking down over the balustrade, saw <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AssemblyDeputation">three men</rs> dressed ceremoniously in black frock-coats with white shirts, and wearing European round hats, enter the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">patio</placeName> from the street. One of them, head and shoulders taller than the two others, advanced with marked gravity, leading the way. This was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#LopezJuste">Don Juste Lopez</rs> accompanied by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AssemblyDeputaiton">two of his friends <!-- "his" refers to Don Juste Lopez --></rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AssemblyDeputation">members of Assembly</rs>, coming to call upon the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Administrador of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName></rs> at this early hour. They saw him too, waved their hands to him urgently, walking up the stairs as if in procession.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#LopezJuste">Don Juste</rs>, astonishingly changed by having shaved off altogether his damaged beard, had lost with it nine-tenths of his outward dignity. Even at that time of serious pre-occupation <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> could not help noting the effect of revealed ineptitude in the aspect of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#LopezJuste">man</rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AssemblyDeputation">His companions <!-- "his" refers to Don Juste Lopez --></rs> looked crestfallen and sleepy. One kept on passing the tip of his tongue over his parched lips; the other's eyes strayed dully over the tiled floor of the corridor, while <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#LopezJuste">Don Juste</rs>, standing a little in advance, harangued the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Señor Administrador of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tome mine</placeName></rs>. It was his firm opinion that forms had to be observed. A new governor is always visited by deputations from the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cabildo">Cabildo</rs>, which is the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cabildo">Municipal Council</rs>, from the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#consulado">Consulado</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#consulado">Commercial Board</rs>,' and it was proper that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Assembly">Provincial Assembly</rs> should send a deputation too, if only to assert the existence of parliamentary institutions. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#LopezJuste">Don Juste</rs> proposed that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos Gould</rs>, as the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">most prominent citizen of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">province</placeName></rs>, should join the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AssemblyDeputation">Assembly's deputation</rs>.</p>

        <div type="chapter" n="3.3.165">
            <head>CHAPTER III. (continued)</head>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> had turned half round to listen patiently, leaning his elbow on  the balustrade. He shook his head a little, refusing, almost touched by the anxious gaze of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#LopezJuste">President of the Provincial Assembly</rs>. It was not <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>'s policy to make the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName> a party to any formal proceedings.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"My advice, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AssemblyDeputation">señores</rs>, is that you should wait for your fate in your houses. There is no necessity for you to give yourselves up formally into <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">Montero</rs>'s hands. Submission to the inevitable, as <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#LopezJuste">Don Juste</rs> calls it, is all very well; but when the inevitable is called <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs> there is no need to exhibit formally the whole extent of your surrender."</said></p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> stopped before the sad bewilderment of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AssemblyDeputation">faces</rs>, the wondering, anxious glances of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AssemblyDeputation">eyes</rs>. The feeling of pity for those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AssemblyDeputation">men</rs>, putting all their trust into words of some sort, while murder and rapine stalked over the land, had betrayed him into what seemed empty loquacity. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#LopezJuste">Don Juste</rs> murmured:</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#LopezJuste">"You are abandoning us, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharleS">Don Carlos</rs>.... And yet, parliamentary institutions..."</said></p> 
            <p>He could not finish from grief. For a moment he put his hand over his eyes. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, in his fear of empty loquacity, made no answer to the charge, returning in silence their ceremonious bows. His taciturnity was his refuge. He understood that what they sought was to get the influence of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName> on their side. They had wanted to go on a conciliating errand to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#revolutionVictor">victor</rs> under the wing of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">Gould Concession</rs>. Other public bodies -- the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cabildo">Cabildo</rs>, the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#consulado">Consulado</placeName> -- would be coming too presently, seeking the support of the most stable, the most effective force they had ever known to exist in their <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">province</placeName>.</p></div> 
        <div type="chapter" n="3.4.165"> 
            <head>CHAPTER IV.</head> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> arriving with his sharp, jerky walk, found the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">master</rs> had retired into <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">his own room</placeName> with orders not to be disturbed on any account. But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> was not anxious to see <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> at once. He spent some time in a rapid examination of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#wounded">his wounded</rs>. He gazed down upon each in turn, rubbing his chin between his thumb and forefinger; his steady stare met without expression their silently inquisitive look. All these cases were doing well; but when he came to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#woundedCargador">dead Cargador</rs> he stopped a little longer, surveying not the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#woundedCargador">man</rs> who had ceased to suffer, but the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#wounedCargadorWife">woman</rs> kneeling in silent contemplation of the rigid face, with its pinched nostrils and a white<cb n="85.165.2"/> gleam in the imperfectly closed eyes. She lifted her head slowly and said in a dull voice: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#woundedCargadorWife">"It is not long since he had become a Cargador -- only a few weeks. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">His worship the Capataz</rs> had accepted him after many entreaties."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I am not responsible for the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">great Capataz</rs>,"</said> muttered the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, moving off with his crippled, brisk step. Directing his course upstairs towards the door of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>'s room</placeName>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> at the last moment hesitated;  then, turning away from the handle with  a shrug of his uneven shoulders, slunk  off hastily along the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">corridor</placeName> in search of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Leonarda"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>'s camerista</rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Leonarda">Leonarda</rs> told him that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Señora</rs> was sleeping. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Señora</rs> had given into her charge the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">girls</rs> belonging to that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Italian posadero</rs>. She, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Leonarda">Leonarda</rs>, had put them to bed in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServantHousing">her own room</placeName>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">fair girl</rs> had cried herself to sleep, but the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">dark one</rs> -- the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">biggest</rs> -- had not closed her eyes yet. She sat up in bed clutching the sheets right up under her chin and staring before her like a little witch. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Leonarda">Leonarda</rs> did not approve of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">Viola children</rs> being admitted to  the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">house</placeName>.</p> 
            <p>She talked in an even undertone. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, rousing himself out of profound reflection, told her abruptly to call <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">her mistress</rs> at once. He hobbled off to wait for <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">sala</placeName>. He was very tired, but too mentally excited to sit down. In this great <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">drawing-room</placeName>, now empty, in which his withered soul had been refreshed after many arid years and his outcast spirit had accepted silently the toleration of many side-glances, he wandered haphazard amongst the chairs and tables till <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>, enveloped in a morning wrapper, came in rapidly.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"You know that I never approved of the silver being sent away,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> began at once as a preliminary to the narrative of his night's adventures in association with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer-in-Chief</rs>, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Viola</rs>, at <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>'s headquarters</placeName>. To the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, with his special conception of this political crisis, the removal of the treasure had seemed an irrational and ill-omened measure. The whole lot of ingots might have been concealed somewhere where they could have been got at for the purpose of staving off the dangers which were menacing the security of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">Gould Concession</placeName>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Administrador</rs> had acted as if the immense and powerful prosperity of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName> had been founded on methods of probity, on the sense of usefulness. And it was nothing of the kind. The method followed had been the only one possible. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">Gould Concession</placeName> had ransomed its way through all those years. What made him uneasy was that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> seemed to him to<cb n="85.165.3"/> have weakened at the decisive moment when a frank return to the old methods was the only chance. Listening to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>'s wild scheme had been a weakness.</p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> flung up his arms, exclaiming, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>! <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>!"</said> He hobbled about the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">room</placeName> with slight, angry laughs. Many years ago both his ankles had been seriously damaged in the course of a certain investigation conducted in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#castle">Castle of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#StaMartha">Sta. Martha</placeName></placeName> by a commission composed of military men. Their nomination had been signified to them unexpectedly at dead of night, with scowling brow, flashing eyes, and in a tempestuous voice, by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoGuzman">Guzman Bento</rs>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoGuzman">old tyrant</rs>, maddened by one of his sudden accesses of suspicion, mingled spluttering appeals to their fidelity with imprecations and horrible menaces. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#castle">cells</placeName> and <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#castle">casemates</placeName> of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#castle">Castle on the hill</placeName> had been already filled with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoPrisoners">prisoners</rs>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoMen">commission</rs> was charged now with the task of discovering the iniquitous conspiracy against the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoGuzman">Citizen Saviour of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">his country <!-- "his" refers to Bento --></placeName></rs>.</p> 
            <p>Their dread of the raving tyrant translated itself into a hasty ferocity of procedure. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoGuzman">Citizen-Saviour</placeName> was not accustomed to wait. A conspiracy had to be discovered. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#castle">courtyards of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#castle">Castle</placeName></placeName> resounded with the clanking of leg-irons, sounds of blows, yells of pain; and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoMen">commission of high officers</rs> laboured feverishly, concealing their distress and apprehensions from each other, and especially from <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">their secretary <!-- "their" refers to Bento Men --></rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">Father Maiz</rs>, an army chaplain, at that time very much in the confidence of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoGuzman">Citizen-Saviour</rs>. He was a big, round-shouldered man, with an unclean-looking, overgrown tonsure on the top of his head, of a dingy, yellow complexion, softly fat, with greasy stains all down the front of his lieutenant's uniform, and a small cross embroidered in white cotton on his left breast. He had a heavy nose and a pendant lip. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> remembered him still. He remembered him against all the force of his will striving its utmost to forget. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">Father Maiz</rs> had been adjoined to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoMen">commission</rs> by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoGuzman">Guzman Bento</rs> expressly for the purpose that his enlightened zeal should assist them in their labours. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> could by no manner of means forget the zeal of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">Father Maiz</rs>, or his face, or the pitiless monotonous voice in which he pronounced the words <said who="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">"Will you confess now"</said> -- an intonation both pitiless and stolid. This memory did not make him shudder, but it had made him what he was in the eyes of respectable people, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">a man careless of common decencies</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">something between a clever vagabond and a disreputable doctor</rs>. But not all respectable people<cb n="85.166.1"/><pb n="166"/> would have had the necessary delicacy of sentiment to understand with what trouble of mind and accuracy of vision <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">medical officer of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé Mine</placeName></rs>, remembered <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">Father Maiz</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">army chaplain</rs>, and once a secretary of a military commission. After all these years <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeHospital">his  rooms <!-- "his" refers to Monygham --></placeName> at the end of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeHospital">hospital building</placeName> in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé gorge</placeName>, remembered <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">Father Maiz</rs> as distinctly as ever. He remembered that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">priest</rs> at night, sometimes in his sleep. On such nights the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> waited for daylight with a candle lighted, and walking the whole length  of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeHospital">his two rooms <!-- "his" refers to Monygham --></placeName> to and fro, staring down at his bare feet, his arms hugging his sides tightly.</p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">priest</rs>'s inquisitorial instincts suffered but little from the want of classical apparatus of the inquisition. At no time of the world's history have men been at a loss how to inflict mental and bodily anguish upon their fellow creatures. A piece of string and a ramrod; a few muskets in combination with a length of hide rope; or even a simple mallet of heavy, hard wood applied with a swing to human fingers or to the joints of a human body is enough for the infliction of the most exquisite torture. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> had been a very stubborn prisoner; and, as a natural consequence of that <said who="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">"bad disposition"</said> (so <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">Father Maiz</rs> called it), his subjugation had been very crushing and very complete. That is why the limp in his walk, the twist of his shoulders, the scars on his cheeks were so pronounced. His confessions, when they came at last, were very complete too. Sometimes on the nights he walked the floor, he wondered, grinding his teeth with shame and rage, at the fertility of his imagination.</p> 
            <p>And he could not forget <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">Father Maiz</rs> with his monotonous phrase, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">"Will you confess now?"</said> reaching him in an awful iteration and lucidity of meaning through the delirious incoherence of unbearable pain. He could not forget. But that was not the worst. Had he met <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">Father Maiz</rs> in the street after all these years <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> was sure he would have quailed before him. This contingency was not to be feared now. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">Father Maiz</rs> was dead; but the sickening certitude prevented <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> from looking anybody in the face.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> had become in a manner the slave of a ghost. It was obviously impossible to take his knowledge of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MaizFather">Father Maiz</rs> <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#EuropeMonyghamHome">home</placeName> to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#EuropeMonyghamHome">Europe</placeName>. When making his extorted confessions to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#MilitaryBoard">Military Board</placeName>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> was not seeking to avoid death. He longed for it. Sitting half-naked for hours on the wet earth of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#castlePrison">his prison</placeName>, and so motionless that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#castlePrisonSpiders">spiders</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#castlePrisonSpiders">his companions</rs>, attached their webs to his matted hair, he consoled the misery of his soul with acute reasonings that he had confessed to crimes enough for a sentence of death -- that they had gone too far with him to let him live to tell the tale.</p> 
            <p>But as if by a refinement of cruelty, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> was left for months to decay slowly in the darkness of his grave-like <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#castlePrison">prison</rs>. It was no doubt hoped that it would finish him off without the trouble of an execution; but <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> had an iron constitution. It was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoGuzman">Guzman Bento</rs> who died, not by the knife thrust of a conspirator, but from a stroke of apoplexy, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> was liberated hastily. His<cb n="85.166.2"/> fetters were struck off by the light of a candle, which, after months of gloom, hurt his eyes so much that he had to cover his face with his hands. He was raised up. His heart was beating violently with the fear of this liberty. When he tried to walk the extraordinary lightness of his feet made him giddy, and he fell down. Two sticks were thrust into his hands, and he was pushed out of the passage. It was dusk; candles glimmered already in the windows of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#castle">officers' quarters</placeName> round the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#castle">courtyard</placeName>; but the twilight sky dazed him by its enormous and overwhelming brilliance. A thin poncho hung over his naked, bony shoulders; the rags of his trousers came down no lower than his knees; an eighteen months' growth of hair fell in dirty grey locks on each side of his sharp cheek-bones. As he dragged himself past the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#castle">guard-room</placeName> door, one of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoMen">soldiers</rs> lolling about outside, moved by some obscure impulse, leaped forward with a strange laugh and rammed a broken old straw hat on his head. And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, after having tottered, continued on his way. He advanced one stick, then one maimed foot, then the other stick; the other foot followed only a very short distance along the ground toilfully, as though it were almost too heavy to be moved at all; and yet his legs under the hanging angles of the poncho appeared no thicker than the two sticks in his hands.</p> 
            <p>In such conditions of manner and attire did <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> go forth to take possession of his liberty. And these conditions seemed to bind him indissolubly to the land of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName> like an awful sort of naturalisation, involving him deep in the national life, far deeper than any amount of success and honour could have done. They did away with his Europeanism. For <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> had made for himself an ideal conception of his disgrace. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>'s view of what it behoved him to do was severe; it was an ideal view in so much that it was the imaginative exaggeration of a correct feeling. It was also in its force, influence, and persistency, the view of an eminently loyal nature.</p> 
            <p>There was a great fund of loyalty in <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>'s nature. He had settled it all on <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>'s head. He believed her worthy of every devotion. At the bottom of his heart he felt an angry uneasiness before the prosperity of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName>, because its growth was robbing her of all peace of mind. <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName> was no place for a woman of that kind. 
                Loyalty to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> could not, however, leave out of account the safety of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">her husband</rs>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> had contrived to be in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> at the critical time because he mistrusted <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>. He considered him hopelessly infected with the madness of revolutions. That is why he hobbled in distress in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">drawing-room</placeName> of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">Casa Gould</placeName> on that morning exclaiming, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>!"</said> in a tone of mournful irritation.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>, her colour heightened, and with glistening eyes, looked straight before her at the sudden enormity of that disaster. The finger tips of one hand rested lightly on a low little table by her side, and the arm trembled right up to the shoulder. The sun, wh1ch looks late upon <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>, issuing in all the fulness of its power high up on<cb n="85.166.3" /> the sky from behind the dazzling snow edge of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Higuerota">Higuerota</placeName>, had decomposed the delicate, smooth, pearly greyness of light, in which the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> lies steeped during the early hours, into sharp-cut masses of black shadows and spaces of hot, blinding glare. Three long rectangles of sunshine fell through the windows of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">sala</placeName>; while just across the street the front of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosHouse">Avellanos's home</placeName> appeared very sombre in its own shadow seen through the flood of light.</p> 
            <p>A voice said at the door:</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"What of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudCharles">Decoud</rs>?"</said></p> 
            <p>It was Charles Gould. They had not heard him coming along the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">corredor</placeName>. His glance just glided over <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">his wife</rs> and struck full at the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"You have brought some news, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>?"</said></p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> blurted it all out at once, in the rough, without a pause. For some time after he had done the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Administrador or the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName></rs> remained looking at him without a word. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> sank into a low chair with her lands lying on her lap. A silence reigned between those three motionless persons; then <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> spoke:</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"You must want some breakfast."</said></p> 
            <p>He stood aside to let <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">his wife</rs> pass first. She caught up <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">her husband</rs>'s hand and pressed it as she went out raising the handkerchief to her eyes. The sight of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">her husband</rs> had brought <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs>'s position to her mind and she could not contain her tears at the thought of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">poor girl</rs>. When she rejoined the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">two men</rs> in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">dining-room</placeName> after having bathed her face, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> was saying to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> across the table:</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"No, there does not seem any room for doubt."</said></p> 
            <p>And the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> assented.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"No, I don't see myself how we could question that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">wretched Hirsch</rs>'s tale. It's only too true, I fear."</said></p> 
            <p>She sat down desolately at the head of the table and looked from one to the other. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould Charles serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">two men</rs>, without absolutely turning their heads away, tried to avoid her glance. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> even made a show of being hungry. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> made no pretence of the sort.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"I am not surprised,"</said> he muttered abandoning his moustaches and throwing one arm over the back of his chair. His face was with that immobility of expression which betrays the intensity of a mental struggle. He felt that this accident had brought to a point all the consequences involved in his line of conduct, with its conscious and subconscious intentions. There must be an end now of this silent reserve of that air of impenetrability behind which he had been safeguarding his dignity. It was the least ignoble form of dissembling forced upon him by that parody of civilised institutions which offended his intelligence, his uprightness, and his sense of right. He was like <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHenry">his father</rs>. He had no ironic eye. He was not amused at the absurdities that prevail in this world. They hurt him in his innate gravity. He felt that the miserable death of that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">poor Decoud</rs> took from him his inaccessible position of a force in the background. It committed him openly unless he wished to throw up the game -- and that was impossible. The material interests required from him the sacrifice of his aloofness -- perhaps his own safety too.</p>

        <div type="chapter" n="3.4.197">
            <head>CHAPTER IV. (continued)</head>
            <p>The only thing that was not changed was his position towards <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Holroyd">Mr. Holroyd</rs>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Holroyd">head of silver and steel interests</rs> had entered into <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName> affairs with a sort of passion. <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName> had become necessary to his existence; in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName> he had found the imaginative satisfaction which other minds would get from drama, from art or from a risky and fascinating sport. It was a special form of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Holroyd">great man</rs>'s extravagance, sanctioned by a moral intention, big enough to flatter his vanity. Even in this aberration of his genius he served the progress of the world. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> felt sure of being understood with precision and judged with the indulgence of their common passion. Nothing now could surprise or startle <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Holroyd">his great man</rs>. And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> imagined himself writing a letter to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanFrancisco">San Francisco</placeName> in some such words: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"....The <rs ref="menAtTheHeadOfTheMovement">men at the head of the movement</rs> are dead or have fled; the civil organisation of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">province</placeName> is at an end for the present; the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Blancos">Blanco party</rs> in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> has collapsed inexcusably, but in the characteristic manner of this <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName>. But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs>, untouched in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Cayta">Cayta</placeName>, remains still available. I am forced to take up openly the plan of a provincial revolution as the only way of putting the enormous material interests involved in the prosperity and peace of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> in a position of permanent safety...."</said> That was clear. He saw these words as if written in letters of fire upon the wall at which he was gazing abstractedly.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> watched his abstraction with dread. It was a domestic and frightful phenomenon that darkened and chilled the house for her like a thundercloud passing over the sun. A man haunted by a fixed idea is insane. He is dangerous even if that idea is an idea of justice; for may he not bring the heaven down pitilessly upon a loved head? The eyes of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>, watching <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">her husband</rs>'s profile, filled with tears again. And again she seemed to see the despair of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">unfortunate Antonia</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">"What would I have done if <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charley</rs> had been drowned while we were engaged?"</said> she exclaimed mentally, with horror. Her heart turned to ice, while her cheeks flamed up as if scorched by the blaze of a funeral pyre consuming all her earthly affections. The tears burst out of her eyes.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntnoia">Antonia</rs> will kill herself!"</said> she cried out.</p> 
            <p>This cry fell into the silence of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">room</placeName> with strangely little effect. Only the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, absently crumbling up a piece of bread, with his head inclined<cb n="812.197.2"/> on one side, raised his face, and the few long hairs sticking out of his shaggy eyebrows stirred in a slight frown. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> thought quite sincerely that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs> was a singularly unworthy object for any woman's affection. Then he lowered his head again with a curl of his lip and his heart full of tender admiration for <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"She thinks of that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">girl</rs>,"</said> he said to himself; <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"she thinks of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">Viola children</rs>; she thinks of me; of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#wounded">wounded</rs>; of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#miners">miners</rs>; she always thinks of everybody who is poor and miserable! But what will she do if <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#">Charles</rs> gets the worst of it in this infernal scrimmage those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosFamily">confounded Avellanos</rs> have drawn her into? No one seems to be thinking of her."</said></p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, staring at the wall pursued his reflections subtly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"I shall write to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Holroyd">Holroyd</rs> that the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé Mine</placeName> is big enough to take in hand the making of a new state. It'll please him. It'll reconcile him to the risk."</said></p> 
            <p>But was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs> really available? Perhaps. But he was inaccessible. To send off a boat to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Cayta">Cayta</placeName> was no longer possible, since <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> was master of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>, and had a steamer at his disposal. And now, with all the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#democrats">Democrats</rs> in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">province</placeName> up, and every <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoTownships">Campo township</rs> in a state of disturbance, where could he find a man who would make his way successfully overland to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Cayta">Cayta</rs>, a ten days' ride at least; a man of courage and resolution, who would avoid arrest or murder, and if arrested would faithfully eat the paper. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">Cargadores</rs></rs> would have been just such a man. But the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">Cargadores</rs></rs> was no more.</p> 
            <p>And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, withdrawing his eyes from the wall, said gently, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"That <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Hirsch</rs>! What an extraordinary thing! Saved himself by clinging to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">anchor</placeName> did he? I had no idea that he was still in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>. I thought he had gone back overland to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Esmeralda">Esmeralda</placeName> a month ago. He came here once to talk to me about his hide business and some other things. I made it clear to him that nothing could be done."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"He was afraid to start back on account of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs> being about,"</said> remarked the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"And but for him we might not have known anything of what has happened,"</said> marvelled <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>.</p> 
            <p> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> cried out:</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs> must not know! She must not be told. Not now."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Nobody's likely to carry the news"</said> remarked the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"It's no one's interest. Moreover, the people here are afraid of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs> as if he were the devil."</said> He turned to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"It's even awkward, because if you wanted to communicate with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#refugees">refugees</rs> you could find no messenger. When <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs> was ranging hundreds<cb n="812.197.3"/> of miles away from here the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers"><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> populace</rs> used to shudder at the tales of him roasting <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#HernandezPrisoners">his prisoners</rs> alive."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"Yes,"</said> murmured <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>; <said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>'s Capataz</rs> was the only man in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> who has seen <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs> eye to eye. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">Father Corbelàn</rs> employed him. He opened the communications first. It is a pity that --"</said></p> 
            <p>His voice was covered by the booming of the great bell of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#cathedral">Cathedral</placeName>. Three single strokes one after another burst out explosively, dying away in deep and mellow vibrations. And then all the bells in the tower of every church, convent, or chapel in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>, even those that had remained shut up for years, pealed out together with the suddenness of a crash. In this furious flood of metallic uproar there was a power of suggesting images of strife and violence which blanched <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>'s cheek. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Basillio">Basilio</rs>, who had been waiting at table, shrinking within himself, clung to the sideboard with chattering teeth. It was impossible to hear yourself speak.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"Shut those windows,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> yelled at him, angrily. All the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">other servants <!-- except Basilio --></rs>, terrified at what they took for the signal of a general massacre, had rushed upstairs, tumbling over each other, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">men</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">women</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">obscure and generally invisible population of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">ground floor</placeName> on the four sides of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">patio</placeName></rs>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">women</rs> screaming <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">"Misericordia!"</rs> ran right into the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">room</placeName> and, falling on their knees against the walls began to cross convulsively. The staring heads of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">men</rs> blocked the doorway in an instant; <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">mozos from the stable</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">gardeners</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">nondescript helpers</rs> living on the crumbs of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">munificent house</placeName> -- and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> beheld all the extent of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">his domestic establishment</rs> even to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldGateKeeper">gatekeeper</rs>. This was a half-paralysed old man, whose long white locks fell down to his shoulders, an heirloom taken up by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>'s familial piety. He could remember <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHenry">Henry Gould</rs>, an Englishman and Costaguanero of the second generation, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xlm#GouldHenry">chief of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco province</placeName></rs>; he had been <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldGateKeeper">his personal mozo</rs> years and years ago in peace and war; had been allowed to attend <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHenry">his master <!--"his" refers to Gould Gate Keeper--> </rs> in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHenryPrison">prison</placeName> <!-- I am almost certain that this is the same prison as the one Monygham was held in at the castle, but until this is confirmed Henry Gould's castle will remain prison as distinct from #castleprison. -->; had on the fatal morning followed the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BentoMen">firing squad</rs> and, peeping from behind one of the cypresses growing along the wall of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#FranciscanConvent">Franciscan Convent</placeName>, had seen, with his eyes starting out of his head, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHenry">Don Enrique</rs> throw up his hands and fall with his face in the dust. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> noted particularly the big patriarchal head of that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldGateKeeper">witness</rs> in the rear of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">other servants <!-- except Gould Gate Keeper --></rs>. But he was surprised to see <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">a shrivelled old hag or two</rs> of whose existence within the walls of his <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">house</placeName> he had not been aware. They must have been the mothers, or even the grandmothers, of<cb n="812.198.1"/><pb n="198"/> some of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">his people</rs>. There were <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">a few children</rs>, too, more or less naked, crying and clinging to the legs of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldServants">their elders</rs>. He had never before noticed any sign of a child in his <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">patio</placeName>. Even <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Leonarda">Leonarda</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Leonarda">camarista</rs>, came in a fright, pushing through, with her spoiled, pouting face of a favourite maid, leading the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">Viola girls</rs> by the hand.</p></div>

            <p>During the night the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">expectant populace</rs> had taken possession of all the belfries in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> in order to welcome <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs>, who was making his entry after having slept the night in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Rincon">Rincon</placeName>. And first came straggling in through the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#landGate">land gate</placeName> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard">armed mob</rs> of all colours, complexions, types, and states of raggedness, calling themselves the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard">Sulaco National Guard</rs>, and commanded by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Señor Gamacho</rs>. Through the middle of the street <!--What street is this? Is this the Calle de la Constitution?--> streamed like a torrent of rubbish a mass of straw hats, ponchos, gun-barrels, with an enormous green and yellow flag flapping in their midst, in a cloud of dust, to the furious beating of drums. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">spectators</rs> recoiled against the walls of the houses shouting <said who="serOgraphies.xml#mob">"Vivas!"</said> Behind them could be seen the lances of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Llaneros">cavalry</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Llaneros">"army" of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedro Montero</rs></rs>. He advanced between <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Señores Fuentes</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs> at the head of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Llaneros">his Llaneros</rs>, who had accomplished the feat of crossing the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Higuerota">Paramos of the Higuerota</placeName> in a snow-storm. They rode four abreast, mounted on <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoHorses">confiscated campo horses</rs>, clad in the heterogeneous stock of roadside stores they had looted hurriedly in their rapid ride through the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#NorthernProvince">northern part of the province</placeName>, for <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedro Montero</placeName> had been in a great hurry to occupy <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>. The handkerchiefs knotted loosely around their bare throats were glaringly new, and all the right sleeves of their cotton shirts had been cut off close to the shoulder for greater freedom in throwing the lazo. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Llaneros">Emaciated greybeards</rs> rode by the side of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Llaneros">lean dark youths</rs>, marked by all the hardships of campaigning, with strips of raw beef twined round the crowns of their hats, and huge iron spurs fastened to their naked heels. Those that in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Higuerota">passes of the mountains</placeName> had lost their lances had provided themselves with the goads used by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoCattleMen"><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Campo">Campo</placeName> cattlemen</rs>: slender shafts of palm fully ten feet long, with a lot of loose rings jingling under the ironshod point. They were armed with knives and revolvers. A haggard fearlessness characterised the expression of all these sun-black countenances; they glared down haughtily with their scorched eyes at the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">crowd</rs>, or, blinking upwards, insolently pointed out to each other some particular head amongst the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">women at the windows</rs>. When they had ridden into the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">Plaza</placeName> and caught sight of the equestrian statue of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#CostaguanaKing">King</placeName> dazzlingly white in the sunshine, towering enormous and motionless above the surges of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">crowd</rs>, with its eternal gesture of saluting, a murmur of surprise ran through their ranks. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Llaneros">"What is that saint in the big hat?"</said> they asked each other.</p> 
            <p>They were a good sample of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#calvaryOfThePlains">cavalry of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plains">plains</placeName></rs> with which <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedro Montero</rs> had helped so much the victorious career of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">his brother the General</rs>. The influence which that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">man</rs> brought up in coast towns, acquired in<cb n="812.198.2"/> a short time over the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#plainsmen">plainsmen of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Republic</placeName></rs> can be ascribed only to a genius for treachery of so effective a kind that it must have appeared to those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#plainsmen">violent men</rs>, but little removed from a state of utter savagery, as the perfection of sagacity and virtue.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedro Montero</rs> had talent for lulling his adversaries into a sense of security. And as men learn wisdom with extreme slowness, and are always ready to believe promises that flatter their secret hopes, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedro Montero</rs> was successful time after time. Whether only a servant or some inferior official in the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CostaguanaLegation">Costaguana Legation</rs> in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Paris">Paris</placeName>, he had rushed back to his <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName> directly he heard <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">his brother</rs> had emerged from the obscurity of his <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroCommandancia">frontier commandancia</placeName>. He had managed to deceive by his gift of plausibility the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ribierists">chiefs of the Ribierist movement</rs> in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">capital</placeName>, and even the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">acute agent of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName></rs> had failed to understand him thoroughly. At once he had obtained an enormous influence over <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">his brother</rs>. They were very much alike in appearance, both bald, with bunches of crisp hair above their ears, arguing the presence of some negro blood. Only <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedro</rs> was smaller than the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">General</rs>, more delicate altogether, with an ape-like faculty for imitating all the outward signs of refinement and distinction, and with a parrot-like talent for languages. Both <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroBrothers">brothers</rs> had received some elementary instruction by the munificence of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroBrothersInstructor">a great European traveller</rs>, to whom their <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroFather">father</rs> had been a body-servant during his journeys in the interior of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName>. In <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">General Montero</rs>'s case it enabled him to rise from the ranks. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">younger, incorrigibly lazy and slovenly</rs>, had drifted aimlessly from one coast town to another, hanging about counting houses, attaching himself to strangers as a sort of valet-de-place, picking up an easy and disreputable living. His ability to read did nothing for him but fill his head with absurd visions. His actions were usually determined by motives so improbable in themselves as to escape the penetration of a rational person.</p> 
            <p>Thus at first the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">agent of the Gould Concession in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#StaMarha">Sta. Martha</placeName></rs> had credited him with the possession of sane views, and even with a restraining power over the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">General</rs>'s everlastingly discontented vanity. It could never have entered his head that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MoteroPedro">lackey or inferior scribe</rs>, lodged in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#ParisHotels">garrets of the various Parisian hotels</placeName> where the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CostaguanaLegation">Costaguana Legation</rs> used to shelter its diplomatic dignity, had been devouring the lighter sort of historical works in the French language, such, for instance, as the books of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AmandImbert">Imbert de Saint Amand</rs> upon the Second Empire. But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs> had been struck by the splendour of a brilliant court, and had conceived the idea of an existence for himself where, like the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MornyDuc">Duc de Morny</rs>, he would associate the command of every pleasure with the conduct of political affairs and enjoy power supremely in every way. Nobody could have guessed that. And yet this was one of the immediate causes of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monterists">Monterist</rs> Revolution.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MoteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs> saw in the elevation of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">his brother</rs> the road wide open to his wildest imaginings. This was what made the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monterists">Monterist</rs> pronunciamiento so unpreventable. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">General</rs> himself probably could have been bought off, pacified with flatteries, despatched on a<cb n="812.198.3"/> diplomatic mission to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Europe">Europe</placeName>. It was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MoteroPedro">his brother</rs> who had egged him on from first to last. He wanted to become the most brilliant statesman of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SouthAmerica">South America</placeName>. He did not desire supreme power. He would have been afraid of its labour and risk in fact. Before all, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs>, taught by his European experience, meant to acquire a serious fortune for himself. With this object in view he obtained from <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">his brother</rs>, on the very morrow of the successful battle, the permission to push on over the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Higuerota">mountains</placeName> and take possession of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>. <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> was the land of future prosperity, the chosen land of material progress, the only <placeName ref="serOgarphies.xml#Sulaco">province</placeName> in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Republic</placeName> of interest to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EuropeanCapitalists">European capitalists</rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs>, following the example of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MornyDuc">Duc de Morny</rs>, meant to have his share of this prosperity. The desire to be on the spot early was the real cause of the celebrated ride over the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Higuerota">mountains</placeName> with a squadron of lancers, an enterprise of which the dangers had not appeared at first clearly to his impatience. Coming from a series of victories, it seemed to him that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroBrothers">a Montero</rs> had only to appear to be master of the situation. This illusion had betrayed him into rashness of which he was becoming aware. As he rode at the head of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Llaneros">his llaneros</rs> he regretted that there was so few of them. The enthusiasm of the populace reassured him. They yelled <said who="serOgraphies.xml#mob">"Viva <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">Montero</rs>! Viva <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs>!"</said> In order to make them still more enthusiastic, and from the natural pleasure he had in dissembling, he dropped the reins on his <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedroHorse">horse</rs>'s neck, and with a tremendous effect of familiarity and confidence slipped his hands under the arms of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Señores Fuentes</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs>. In that posture, with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#TownMozo">a ragged town mozo</rs> holding <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedroHorse">his horse</rs> by the bridle, he rode triumphantly across the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">Plaza</placeName> to the door of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">Intendencia</placeName>.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedro Montero</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">brother of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">General</rs></rs>, dismounted into <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">a shouting and perspiring throng of enthusiasts</rs> whom the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard">ragged Nationals</rs> were pushing back fiercely. Ascending a few steps, he surveyed the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">large crowd</rs> gaping on him and the bullet-speckled walls of the house opposite lightly veiled by a sunny haze of dust. The word "PORVENIR" in immense black capitals, alternating with broken windows, stared at him across the vast space; and he thought with delight of the hour of vengeance, because he was very sure of laying his hands upon <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>. On his left hand <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs>, big and hot, wiping his hairy, wet face, uncovered a set of yellow fangs in a grin of stupid hilarity. On his left, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Señor Fuentes</rs>, small and lean, looked on with compressed lips. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">crowd</rs> stared, literally open-mouthed, lost in eager stillness, as though they had expected the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">great guerillero</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">famous Pedrito</rs>, to begin scattering at once some sort of visible largesse. What he began was a speech. He began it with the shouted word <said who="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">Citizens</rs>!"</said> which reached even <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">those in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">middle of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">Plaza</placeName></placeName></rs>. Afterwards the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">greater part of the citizens</rs> remained fascinated by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">orator</rs>'s action alone. The <emph>vivas</emph> of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">those nearest to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">orator</rs></rs> bursting out suddenly, propagated themselves irregularly to the confines of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">crowd</rs>, like flames running over dry grass, and expired in the opening of the streets.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER V. (continued)</head>  
            <p>In the intervals over the swarming <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">Plaza</placeName> brooded a heavy silence, in which the mouth of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">orator</rs> went on opening, and shutting, and detached phrases -- <said who="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">"The happiness of the people,"</said> <said who="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">Sons of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName></rs>,"</said> <said>"The entire world, el mundo entiero"</said> -- reached even the packed steps of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#cathedral">Cathedral</placeName> with a feeble clear ring, thin as the buzzing of a mosquito. But the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">orator</rs> struck his breast; he seemed to prance between <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">his two supporters</rs>. It was the supreme effort of his peroration. Then the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">two smaller figures</rs> disappeared from the public gaze and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">enormous Gamacho</rs>, left alone, advanced, raising his hat high above his head. Then he covered himself proudly, and yelled out, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">Ciudadanos</rs>!"</said> A dull roar greeted <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Señor Gamacho</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">ex-pedlar of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Campo">Campo</placeName></rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Commandante of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard">National Guards</rs></rs>.</p> 
            <p><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">Upstairs</placeName> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs> walked about rapidly from one wrecked room of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">Intendencia</placeName> to another, snarling incessantly: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">"What stupidity! What destruction!"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Señor Fuentes</rs>, following, would relax his taciturn disposition to murmur, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#fuentes">"It is all the work of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard">his Nationals</rs>,"</said> and then inclining his head on his left shoulder would press together his lips so firmly that a little hollow would appear at each corner. He had his nomination for Political Chief of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> in his pocket, and was all impatience to enter upon his functions. In the long <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">audience room</placeName>, with its tall mirrors all starred by stones, the hangings torn down and the canopy over the platform at the upper end pulled to pieces, the vast deep muttering of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">crowd</rs> and the howling voice of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs> speaking just below reached them through the shutters as they stood idly in dimness and desolation.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xl#MonteroPedro">"The brute,"</said> observed <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">his Excellency Don Pedro Montero</rs> through clenched teeth. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">"We must contrive as quick as possible to send him and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard">his Nationals</rs> out there to fight <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs>."</said></p> 
            <p>The new <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Géfé Politico</rs> only jerked his head sideways, and took a puff at his cigarette.</p>  
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs> looked with disgust at the absolutely bare floor, and at the belt of heavy gilt picture-frames running round the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">room</placeName>, out of which the remnants of torn and slashed canvases fluttered·like dingy rags.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">"We are not barbarians,"</said> he said.</p> 
            <p>This was what said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">his Excellency the popular Pedrito</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">guerillero skilled in the art of laying ambushes</rs>, charged by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">his brother</rs> at his own demand with the organisation of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> on democratic principles. The night before,<cb n="819.229.2"/> during the consultation with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedroPartisans">his partisans</rs> who had come out to meet him in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Rincon">Rincon</placeName>, he had opened his intentions to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Señor Fuentes</rs>: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">"We shall organise a popular vote, by yes or no, confiding the destinities <!-- sic --> of our beloved <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName> to the wisdom and valiance of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">my heroic brother</rs>, the invincible General. A plebiscite. Do you understand?"</said> And <rs ref="serOgarphies.xml#Fuentes">Señor Fuentes</rs>, puffing out his leathery cheeks, had inclined his head slightly to the left. He understood.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">His Excellency</rs> was exasperated at the devastation. Not a single chair, table, sofa, etagére or console had been left in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">state rooms</placeName> of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">Intendencia</placeName>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">His Excellency</rs>, though twitching all over with rage, was restrained from bursting into violence by a sense of his remoteness and isolation. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">His heroic brother</rs> was very far away. Meantime, how was he going to take his siesta? He had expected to find comfort and luxury in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">Intendencia</placeName> after a year of hard camp life, ending with the hardships and privations of the daring dash upon <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>. He would get even with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs> by and bye. And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Señor Gamacho</rs>'s oration; delectable to popular ears, went on in the heat and glare of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">Plaza</placeName> like the uncouth howlings of an inferior sort of devil cast into a white-hot furnace.</p></div> 
        <div type="chapter" n="3.6.229"><head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
            <p>The morning was wearing on; there were already signs of disruption, currents and eddies in the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">crowd</rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Llaneros">Horsemen</rs> spurred through shouting; groups of sombreros set level on heads against the vertical sun were drifting away into the streets where the open doors of pulperias revealed an enticing gloom resounding with the gentle tinkling of guitars. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard">National Guards</rs> were thinking of siesta, and the eloquence of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">their chief</rs>, was exhausted. Later on, when in the cooler hours of the afternoon they tried to assemble again for farther consideration of public affairs, detachments of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Llaneros"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Montero</rs>'s cavalry</rs> camped on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Alameda">Alameda</placeName> charged them without parley, at speed, with long lances levelled at their flying backs as far as the ends of the streets. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard">National Guards of Sulaco</rs> were surprised by this proceeding. But they were not indignant. No Costaguanero had ever learned to question the eccentricities of a military force. But the motive of it escaped their unaided intelligence, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">their chief and orator</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Commandante of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard">National Guard</rs></rs>, was lying drunk and asleep in the bosom of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GamachoFamily">his family</rs>.</p> 
            <p>The declining sun had shifted the shadows from east to west amongst the houses of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>. It had shifted them upon the whole extent of the im<cb n="819.229.3"/>mense <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Campo">Campo</placeName>, with the white walls of its <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoHaciendas">haciendas on the knolls</placeName> dominating the green distances; with its <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoRanches">grass-thatched ranches</placeName> crouching in the folds of ground by the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#CampoStreams">banks of streams</placeName>; with the dark islands of clustered trees on a clear sea or grass, and the precipitous range of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xmlCordillera">Cordillera</placeName>, immense and motionless, emerging from the billows of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lowerForests">lower forests</placeName> like the barren coast of a land of giants. From the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plain">plain</placeName> the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">stamp sheds</placeName> and the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">houses of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName></placeName> appeared dark and small, high up, like the nests of birds clustered on the ledges of a cliff. The zigzag paths resembled faint tracings scratched on the wall of a cyclopean block-house. To the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#miners">two sereños of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName></rs> on day duty, strolling, carbine in hand, and watchful eyes, in the shade of the trees lining the stream near the bridge, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs>, descending the path from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">upper plateau</placeName>, seemed no bigger than a large beetle.</p> 
            <p>With his air of aimless, insect-like going to and fro upon the face of the rock, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs>'s figure kept on descending steadily, and, when near the bottom, sank at last behind the roofs of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">storehouses</placeName>, <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">forges</placeName>, and <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">workshops</placeName>. For a time the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#miners">pair of sereños</rs> strolled back and forth before the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">bridge</placeName>, on which they had stopped <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#townHorseman">a horseman</rs> holding a large white envelope in his hand. Then <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs>, emerging in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">village street</placeName> from amongst the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">houses</placeName>, not a stone's throw from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">frontier bridge</placeName>, approached, striding in wide dark trousers tucked into boots, a white linen jacket, sabre at his side, and revolver at his belt. In this disturbed time nothing could find the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Señor Gobernador</rs> with his boots off, as the saying is.</p> 
            <p>At a slight nod from one of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#miners">sereños</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#townHorseman">man</rs>, a messenger from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>, dismounted, and crossed the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">bridge</placeName>, leading <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#townHorsemanHorse">his horse</rs> by the bridle.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs> received the letter from his other hand, slapped his left side and his hips in succession in order to feel his spectacle case. After settling the heavy silver-mounted affair astride his nose, and adjusting it carefully behind his ears, he opened the envelope, holding it up at about a foot in front of his eyes. The paper he palled out contained some three lines of writing. He looked at them for a long time. His grey moustache moved slightly up and down, and the wrinkles radiating at the corners of his eyes, ran together. He nodded serenely. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">"Bueno,"</said> he said.</p> <said who="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">"There is no answer."</said>
            <p>Then in his quiet kindly way he engaged in a cautious conversation with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#townHorseman">man</rs>, who was willing to talk cheerily as if something lucky had happened to him recently. He had seen from a distance <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>'s infantry</rs> camped along the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">shore of the harbour</placeName> on each side<cb n="819.230.1"/><pb n="230"/> of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Custom House</placeName>. They had done no damage to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">buildings</placeName>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayForeigners">foreigners of the railway</rs> remained shut up within the <rs ref="serOGraphies.xml#railway">yards</rs>. They were no longer anxious to shoot <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#poorPeople">poor people</rs>. He cursed the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayForeigners">foreigners</rs>; then he reported <rs ref="serOGraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Montero</rs>'s entry, and the rumours of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#poorPeople">poor</placeName> were going to be made rich now. That was very good. More he did not know, and, breaking into propitiatory smiles, he intimated that he was hungry and thirsty. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">old major</rs> directed him to go to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#alcaldeFirst">alcalde of the first village</rs>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#townHorseman">man</rs> rode off, and Don Pepé, striding slowly in the direction of a little wooden <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeBelfry">belfry</placeName>, looked over the hedge into a <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeBelfry">little garden</placeName> and saw <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">Father Romàn</rs> sitting in a white hammock slung between two orange trees in front of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeBelfry">presbytery</placeName>.</p> 
            <p>An enormous tamarind shaded with its dark foliage the whole white frame <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeBelfry">house</placeName>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeBelfryGirl">A young Indian girl</rs> with long hair, big eyes, and small hands and feet, carried out a wooden chair, while <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeBelfryOldWoman">a thin old woman</rs>, crabbed and vigilant, watched her all the time from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeBelfry">verandah</placeName>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs> sat down in the chair and lighted a cigar; the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">priest</rs> drew in an immense quantity of snuff out of the hollow of his palm.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs>, in a mild and humorous voice, informed <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">Father Romàn</rs> that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs>, by the hand of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Señor Fuentes</rs>, had asked him on what terms he would surrender the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName> in proper working order to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedroMen">a legally constituted commission of patriotic citizens</rs>, escorted by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedroMen">a small military force</rs>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">priest</rs> cast his eyes up to heaven. However, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs> continued, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#townHorseman">mozo who brought the letter</rs> said that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos Gould</rs> was alive and so far unmolested.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">Father Romàn</rs> expressed in a few words his thankfulness at hearing of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Señor Administrador</rs>'s safety.</p> 
            <p>The hour of oracion had gone by in the silvery ringing of a bell in the little <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeBelfry">belfry</placeName>. The belt of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lowerForest">forest</placeName> closing the entrance of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">valley</placeName> was like a screen between the low sun and the street of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">village</placeName>. Knots of people sat at the doors of wattled huts. Up the street, before the large <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#alcaldeFirstHouse">hut of the Alcalde</placeName>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#miners">foremen of the night-shift</rs>, already assembled to lead <rs ref="erOgraphies.xml#miners">their men</rs>, squatted on the ground in a circle of leather skull caps, and bowing their bronze backs were passing round the gourd of maté. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#townHorseman">mozo from the town</rs>, having fastened <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#townhorsemanHorse">his horse</rs> to a wooden post before the door, was telling them the news of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> as the blackened gourd of the decoction passed from hand to hand. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#alcaldeFirst">grave Alcalde</rs> himself, in a white waistcloth and a flowered chintz gown with sleeves, open wide upon his naked stout person with an effect of a gaudy bathing robe, stood by, wearing a rough beaver hat at the back of his head, and grasping a tall staff with a silver knob in his hand. These insignia of his dignity had been conferred upon him by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Administration of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName></rs>, the fountain of honour, of prosperity, and peace. He had been one of the first immigrants into this <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">valley</placeName>; <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#alcaldeFirstFamily">his sons</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#alcaldeFirstFamily">sons-in-law</rs> worked within the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mountain</placeName> which seemed, with its treasures, to pour down the thundering ore shoots of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">upper mesa</placeName>, the gifts of wellbeing, security and justice upon the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#miners">toilers</rs>. He listened to the news from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> with curiosity and indifference, as if concerning<cb n="819.230.2"/> another world than his own. And it was true that they appeared to him so. In a very few years the sense of belonging to a powerful organisation had been developed in these <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Indians">harassed, half-wild Indians</rs>. They were proud of, and attached to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#mine">mine</placeName>. It had secured their confidence and belief. It never entered the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#alcaldeFirst">Alcalde</rs> <!-- sic no "'s" --> head that the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName> could fail in its protection and force.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">Padre Romàn</rs> sat dejectedly balancing himself, his feet just touching the ground, his hands gripping the edge of the hammock. With less confidence, but as ignorant as <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeVillagers">his flock</rs>, he asked the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">major</rs> what did he think was going to happen now.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs>, bolt upright in the chair, folded his hands peacefully on the hilt of his sword, standing perpendicular between his thighs, and answered that he did not know. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName> could be defended against any force likely to be sent to take possession. On the other hand, from the arid character of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">valley</placeName>, when the regular supplies from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Campo">Campo</placeName> had been cut off the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeVillagers">population of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">three villages</placeName></rs> could be starved into submission. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs> exposed these contingencies with serenity to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">Father Romàn</rs>, who, as an old campaigner, was able to understand the reasoning of a military man. They talked with simplicity and directness. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">Father Romàn</rs> was saddened at the idea of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeVillagers">his flock</rs> being scattered or else enslaved. He had no illusions as to their fate, not from penetration, but from long experience of political atrocities, which seemed to him fatal and unavoidable in the life of a state. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">Father Romàn</rs>'s clear-sightedness was served by an uninformed intelligence; but his heart, preserving its tenderness amongst scenes of carnage, spoliation, and violence, abhorred these calamities the more as his association with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeVillagers">victims</rs> was closer. He entertained towards the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Indians">Indians of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">valley</placeName></rs> the feelings of paternal scorn. He had been marrying, baptising, confessing, absolving, and burying the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#miners">workers of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tome mine</placeName></rs> with dignity and unction for five years or more; and he believed in the sacredness of these ministrations, which made them his own in a spiritual sense. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>'s earnest interest in the concerns of these <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeVillagers">people</rs> enhanced their importance in the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">priest</rs>'s eyes, because it really augmented his own. When talking over with her the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTomeVillagerWomen">innumerable Marias and Brigitas of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">villages</placeName></rs> he felt his own humanity expand. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">Padre Romàn</rs> was incapable of fanaticism to an almost reprehensible degree. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Señorita</rs> was evidently a heretic; but at the same time she seemed to him wonderful and angelic. At the thought of what might befall the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">illustrious Señora</rs>, presently he became gradually overcome with dismay. He voiced it in an agitated murmur. Even <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs> lost his serenity for a moment. He leaned forward stiffly.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">"Listen, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">Padre</rs>. The very fact that those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroBrothers">thieving macaques in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName></rs> are trying to find out the price of my honour proves that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Señor Don Carlos</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CasaGouldOccupants">all in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">Casa Gould</placeName></rs> are safe. As to my honour, that also is safe, as every man, woman, and child knows. But the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Liberals">negro Liberals</rs> who have snatched the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> by surprise do not know that. Bueno. Let them sit and wait. While they wait they can do no harm."</said></p> 
            <p>And he regained his composure. He<cb n="819.230.3"/> regained it easily because whatever happened his honour of an old officer of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Paez">Paez</rs> was safe. He had promised <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> that at the approach of an armed force he would defend the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">gorge</placeName> just long enough to give himself time to destroy scientifically the whole <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">plant</placeName>, <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">buildings</placeName>, and <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">workshops</placeName> of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName> with heavy charges of dynamite; block with ruins the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">main tunnel</placeName>, break down the pathways, blow up the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">dam</placeName> of the water power, send the famous <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">Gould Concession</placeName> sky-high out of a horrified world. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName> had got hold of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> with a grip as deadly as ever it had laid upon <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHenry">his father</rs>. But this extreme resolution had seemed to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs> the most natural thing in the world. His measures had been taken with judgment. Everything was prepared with a careful completeness.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs>, still calm, stroked his grey and pendant moustache, whose long, fine ends hung far below the clean-cut line of his jaw, and spoke with a conscious pride in his reputation.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">"So, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">Padre</rs>, I don't know what will happen. But I know that as long as I am here <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs> can speak to that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">macaque</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs>, and threaten the destruction of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName> with perfect assurance that he will be taken seriously. For people know me."</said></p> 
            <p>He began to turn the cigar in his lips a little nervously, and went on.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">"But that is talk -- good for the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#politicos">politicos</rs>. I am a military man. I do not know what may happen. But I know what ought to be done -- the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#miners">mine</rs> should march upon the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> with guns, axes, knives tied up to sticks, Por Dios. Only --"</said></p> 
            <p>His folded hand twitched on the hilt. The cigar turned faster in the corner of his lips.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">"And who should lead but I? Unfortunately -- observe -- I have given my word not to let the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName> fall into the hands of these <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroBrothers">thieves</rs>. In war -- you know this, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">Padre</rs> -- the fate of battles is uncertain, and whom could I leave here? The explosives are ready. But it would require a man of high honour, of intelligence, of judgment, of courage. Another old officer of <prs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Paez">Paez</prs> -- or -- or -- perhaps one of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Paez">Paez</rs>'s old chaplains would do."</said> 
                He got up, long, lank, upright, hard, with his martial moustache and the bony structure of his face, from which the glance of the sunken eyes seemed to transfix the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RomanFather">priest</rs>, who stood still, an empty wooden snuff-box held upside down in his hand, and glared back at the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">governor of the mine</rs>.</p>       
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="3.7.261">
            <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
            <p>At about that time, in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">Intendencia of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName></placeName>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> was assuring <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs>, who had sent a request for his presence there, that he would never let the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName> pass out of his hands for the profit of a Government who had robbed him of it. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Gould Concession</placeName> could not be resumed. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHenry">His father</rs> had not desired it. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">son</rs> would never surrender it. He would never surrender it alive. And once dead, where was the power capable of resuscitating such an enterprise in all its vigour and wealth out of the ashes and ruin of destruction? There was no such power in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName>. And where was the skill and capital abroad that would condescend to touch such an ill-omened corpse? <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> talked in the impassive tone which had for many years served to conceal his anger and contempt. He suffered. He was disgusted with what he had to say. It was too much like heroics. In him the strictly practical instinct was in profound discord with the almost mystic view he took of his right. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">Gould Concession</placeName> was symbolic of abstract justice. Let the heavens fall. But since the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé Mine</placeName> had developed into world-wide fame his threat had enough force and effectiveness to reach the rudimentary intelligence of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedro Montero</rs>, wrapped up as it was in the futilities of historical anecdotes.</p> 
            <p>A table, a chair, a wooden bedstead had been procured for <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">His Excellency</rs>, who, after a short siesta, rendered absolutely necessary by the labours and the pomps of his entry into <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>, had been getting hold of the administrative machine by making appointments, giving orders, and signing proclamations. Alone with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> in the audience-room, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">His Excellency</rs> managed with his well-known skill to conceal his annoyance and consternation. He had begun at first to talk loftily of confiscation, but the want of all proper feeling and mobility in the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Señor Administrador</rs>'s features ended by affecting adversely his power of masterful expression. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> had repeated: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monterists">Government</rs> can certainly bring about the destruction of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé  Mine</placeName> if it likes but without me it can do nothing else."</said> It was an alarming pronouncement, and well calculated to offend the sensibilities of a politician whose mind is bent upon the spoils of victory. And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> said also that the destruction of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé Mine</placeName> would cause the ruin of other undertakings, the withdrawal of European capital, the withholding, most<cb n="826.261.2"/> probably, of the last instalment of the foreign loan. That <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">stony fiend of a man</rs> said all these things (which were accessible to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">His Excellency</rs>'s intelligence) in a cold-blooded manner which made you shudder.</p>
            <p>A long course of reading of historical works of a light and gossipy character, carried out in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Paris">garrets of Parisian hotels</placeName>, sprawling on an untidy bed, to the neglect of his duties, menial or otherwise, had affected the manners of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedro Montero</rs>. Had he seen around him the splendour of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">old Intendencia</placeName>, the magnificent hangings, the gilt furniture ranged along the walls; had he stood under the dais on a noble square of red carpet, he would have probably been very dangerous from a sense of success and elevation. But in this sacked and <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">devastated residence</placeName>, with the three pieces of common furniture huddled lamentably in the middle of the vast apartment, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs>'s imagination was subdued by a feeling of insecurity and impermanence. That feeling, and the firm attitude of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> to dismiss from his mind every cause for alarm. He was now conversing, he reminded him, with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">brother of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">master of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName></rs></rs>, charged with a reorganising mission. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">trusted brother of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">master of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName></rs></placeName>, he repeated. Nothing was further from the thoughts of that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">wise and patriotic hero</rs> than the ideas of destruction. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">"I entreat you, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs>, not to give way to your anti-democratic prejudices,"</said> he cried , in a burst of condescending effusion. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs> surprised one at first by the vast development of his bald forehead, a shiny yellow expanse between the crinkly coal-black tufts of hair without any lustre, and engaging form of his mouth, and an unexpectedly cultivated voice. But his eyes, very glistening, as if freshly painted on each side of his hooked nose, had a round, hopeless, bird-like stare when opened fully. Now, however, he narrowed them agreeably, throwing his square chin up and speaking with closed teeth slightly through the nose, with what he imagined to be the manner of a grand seigneur. In that attitude, he declared suddenly that the highest expression of democracy was Cæsarism, the imperial rule based upon the direct popular vote. Cæsarism was conservative. It was strong. It recognised the legitimate need of democracy which required orders, titles, and distinctions. They would be showered upon deserving men. Cæsarism was peace. It was progres<cb n="826.261.3"/>sive. It secured the prosperity of a country. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs> was carried away. Look at what the Second Empire had done for <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#France">France</placeName>. It was a régime which delighted to honour men of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs>'s stamp. The Second Empire fell, but that was because its <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#NapoleonIII">chief</rs> was devoid of that military genius which had raised <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">General Montero</rs> to the pinnacle of fame and glory. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs> elevated his hand jerkily to help the idea of pinnacle of fame. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">"We shall have many talks yet. We shall understand each other thoroughly, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs>!"</said> he cried in a tone of fellowship. Republicanism had done its work. Imperial democracy was the power of the future. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">guerillero</rs>, showing his hand, lowered his voice forcibly. A man singled out by his fellow citizens for the honourable name of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">El Rey de <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName></rs> could not but receive a full recognition from an imperial democracy as a great captain of industry and a person of weighty counsel, whose popular designation would be soon replaced by a more solid sort of title. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">"Eh, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs>? No! What do you say?"</said></p>      
            <p>He ceased. The air was cool on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">plaza</placeName>, where a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Llaneros">patrol of cavalry</rs> rode round and round without penetrating into the streets, which resounded with shouts and strumming of guitars issuing from the open doors of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#pulperias">pulperias</placeName>. The orders were not to interfere with the enjoyments of the people. After a time <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs>, thrusting his hand in the bosom of his coat, bowed his head with slow dignity. The audience was over.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> on going out passed his hand over his forehead as if to dissipate the mists of an oppressive dream whose grotesque extravagance leaves behind a subtle sense of bodily danger and intellectual misery. In the passages and on the staircases of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">old palace</placeName> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroMen"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Montero">Montero</rs>'s troopers</rs> lounged about insolently, smoking, and making way for no one. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#deputations">Three silent groups of civilians</rs> in severe black waited in the main gallery, formal and helpless, a little huddled up, each keeping apart from the others, as if in the exercise of a public function they had been overcome by a desire to shun the notice of every eye. These were the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#deputations">deputations</rs> waiting for their audience. The <rs ref="serOgarphies.xml#AssemblyDeputation">one from the Provincial Assembly</rs>, more restless and uneasy in its corporate expression, was overtopped by the big face of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#LopezJuste">Don Juste Lopez</rs>, soft and white, with prominent eyelids and wreathed in an invincible solemnity as if in a dense cloud. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#LopezJuste">President of the Provincial Assembly</rs> coming bravely to save the last shred of parliamentary institutions (on the English model) averted his eyes<cb n="826.262.1"/><pb n="262"/> from the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Administrador of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé Mine</placeName></rs> as a dignified rebuke of his little faith in that only saving principle.</p> 
            <p>The mournful severity of that reproof did not affect <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, but he was sensible to the glances of the others directed upon him without reproach, as if only to read their own fate upon his face. All of them had talked, shouted, and declaimed in the great sala of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">Casa Gould</placeName>. The feeling of compassion for those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#deputations">men</rs> struck with a strange impotence in the toils of moral degradation, did not induce him to make a sign. He suffered from his fellowship in evil with them too much. He crossed the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">Plaza</placeName> unmolested. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> found the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> still in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">his house</placeName>.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> came away from the crack in the shutter through which he had been watching the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Calle">street</placeName>.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Ah! You are back at last!"</said> he said, in a tone of relief. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I have been telling <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> that you were perfectly safe, but I was not by any means certain that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroMen">fellows</rs> would have let you go."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"Neither was I,"</said> confessed <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, laying his hat on the table.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"You will have to take action."</said></p> 
            <p>The silence of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> seemed to admit that this was the only course. This was as far as <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> was accustomed to go towards expressing his intentions.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I hope you did not warn <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Montero</rs> of what you mean to do,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> said, anxiously.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"I tried to make him see that the existence of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName> was bound up with my personal safety,"</said> continued <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, looking away from the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> and fixing his eyes upon the water-colour sketch upon the wall.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"He believed you?"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> asked, eagerly.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"God knows!"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"I owed it to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">my wife</rs> to say that much. He is well enough informed. He knows that I have <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs> there. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Fuentes</rs> must have told him. They know that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DonPepe">old Major</rs> is perfectly capable of blowing up the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName> without hesitation or compunction. Had it not been for that I don't think I'd have left the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">Intendencia</placeName> a free man. He would blow everything up from loyalty and from hate -- from hate of these <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Liberals">Liberals</rs> as they call themselves. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Liberals">Liberals</rs>! The words one knows so well have a nightmarish meaning in this <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName>. Liberty democracy, patriotism, government -- all of them have a flavour of folly and murder. Haven't they, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>? ... I alone can restrain <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs>. If they were to -- to do away with me, nothing could prevent him."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">"They will try to tamper with him,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> suggested, thoughtfully.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"It is very possible,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> said, very low, as if speaking to himself, and still gazing at the sketch of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé gorge</placeName> upon the wall. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"Yes, I expect they will try that."</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> looked for the first time at the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"It would give me time,"</said> he added.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monyham">"Exactly,"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, suppressing his excitement. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Especially if <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs> behaves diplomatically. Why shouldn't he give them some hope of success? Eh? Otherwise you wouldn't gain so much time. Couldn't he be instructed to --"</said></p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, looking at the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> steadily, shook his head, but the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> continued with a certain amount of fire:</p><cb n="826.262.2"/>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"Yes, to enter into negotiations for the surrender of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName>. It is a good notion. You would mature your plan. Of course, I don't ask what it is. I don't want to know. I would refuse to listen to you if you tried to kill me. I am not, fit for confidences."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"What nonsense!"</said> muttered <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>, with displeasure. He disapproved of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>'s sensitiveness about that far-off episode of his life. So much memory shocked <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs>. It was like morbidness. And again he shook his head. He refused to tamper with this open rectitude of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs>'s conduct, both from taste and from policy. Instructions would have to be either verbal or in writing. In either case they ran the risk of being intercepted. It was by no means certain that a messenger could reach the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName>; and, besides, there was no one to send. It was on the tip of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles</rs>'s tongue to say that only the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">late Capataz of Cargadores</rs> could have been employed with some chance of success and the certitude of discretion. But he did not say that. He pointed out to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> that it would have been bad policy. Directly <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs> let it be supposed that he could be bought over the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Administrador</rs>'s personal safety and the safety of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldFriends">his friends</rs> would become endangered. The incorruptibility of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs> was the essential and restraining thing. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> hung his head and admitted that in a way it was so.</p> 
            <p>He couldn't deny to himself that the reasoning was sound enough. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#PepeDon">Don Pepé</rs>'s usefulness consisted in his unstained character. As to his own usefulness, he reflected bitterly it was also in his own character. He declared to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> that he had the means of keeping <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> from joining his forces with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroGeneral">Montero</rs> at least for the present. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"If you had had all this silver here,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> said, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"or even if it had been known to be at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName>, you could have bribed <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> to throw off his recent Monterism. You could have induced him either to go away in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloShip">his steamer</placeName> or even to join you."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"Certainly not that last,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Charles Gould</rs> declared, firmly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">"What could one do with a man like that afterwards -- tell me, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>? The silver is gone, and I am glad of it. It would have been an immediate and strong temptation. The scramble for that visible plunder would have precipitated a disastrous ending. I would have had to defend it, too. I am glad we've removed it -- even if it is lost. It would have been a danger and a curse."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Perhaps he is right,"</said> the <rs  ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> an hour later said hurriedly to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>, whom he met in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">corredor</placeName>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"The thing is done, and the shadow of the treasure may do just as well as the substance. Let me try to serve you to the whole extent of my evil reputation. I am off now to play my game of betrayal with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, and keep him off the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>."</said> She put out both her hands impulsively.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, you are running a terrible risk,"</said> she whispered averting from his face her eyes, full of tears, for a short glance at the door of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">her husband</rs>'s room</placeName>. She pressed both his hands, and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monyham">Doctor</rs> stood as if rooted to the spot, looking down at her, and trying to twist his lips into a smile.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Oh, I know you will defend my memory,"</said> he uttered at last, and ran<cb n="826.262.3"/> tottering down the stairs across the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">patio</placeName>, and out of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">home</placeName>. In the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Calle">street</placeName> he kept up a great pace with his smart hobbling walk, a case of instruments under his arm. He was known for being loco -- mad. Nobody interfered with him. From under the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#seawardGate">seaward gate</placeName>, across the dusty, arid little <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plain">plain</placeName>, interspersed with low bushes, he saw, a mile away, the ugly enormity of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Custom House</placeName>, and the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#seaport">two or three other buildings</placeName> which at that time constituted the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#seaport">seaport of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#seaport">Sulaco</placeName></placeName>. Far away to the south groves of palm trees edged the curve of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> shore. The distant peaks of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Cordilleras">Cordilleras</placeName> were losing their identity of clear shapes in a steadily deepening blue of the eastern sky. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> walked briskly. A darkling shadow seemed to fall upon him from the zenith. The sun had set. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, holding a straight course for the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Custom House</placeName>, appeared lonely hopping amongst the dark bushes like a tall bird with a broken wing.</p></div> 
        <div><head type="chapter" n="3.7.262">CHAPTER VIII.</head> 
            <p>Tints of purple, gold, and crimson were mirrored in the clear water of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>. A long tongue of land, straight as a wall, with the grass-grown ruins of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldFort">fort</placeName> making a sort of rounded green mound, plainly visible from the inner shore, closed its circuit; and beyond the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">Placido</placeName> repeated those splendours of colouring on a greater scale with an enormous and more sombre magnificence. The great mass of cloud filling the head of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">gulf</placeName> had long red smears amongst its convoluted folds of grey and black, as of a floating mantle stained with blood. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Isabels">three Isabels</placeName> overshadowed and clear cut in a great smoothness, confounding the sea and sky appeared suspended, purple-black, in the air. The little wavelets seemed to be tossing a mass of tiny red sparks upon the sandy beaches. The glassy bands of water along the horizon gave out a fiery red glow as if fire and water had been mingled together in the vast bed of the ocean.</p> 
            <p>At last the conflagration of sea and sky lying embraced and asleep in a flaming contact upon the edge of the world, went out. The red sparks in the water vanished together with the stains of blood in the black mantle draping the sombre head of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">Placid Gulf</placeName>; and a fresh puff of breeze rose, rustling heavily the thick growth of bushes on the ruined earthworks of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldFort">fort</placeName>, and died out with a long soughing stir in the branches of crooked dwarf trees growing upon the rock-like creviced face of a bastion. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> woke up from a fourteen hours' sleep, and arose full length from his lair in the long grass. He stood knee deep amongst the whispering undulations of the green blades with the lost air of a man just born into the world. But quickly the look of recognition came into his eyes. Handsome, robust, and supple, he threw back his head, flung his arms open, and stretched himself with a slow twist of the waist and a leisurely growling yawn of white teeth, as natural and free from evil in the moment of waking as a magnificent and unconscious wild beast. Then, in the suddenly steadied glance fixed upon nothing from under a forced frown, appeared the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">man</rs>.</p> 
            <p>After landing from his swim <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs><cb n="826.263.1"/><pb n="263"/> had scrambled up, all dripping, into the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldFort">main quadrangle</placeName> of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldFort">old fort</placeName>; and there, amongst ruined bits of walls and rotting remnants of roofs and <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldFort">sheds</placeName>, he had slept the day through. He had slept in the shadow of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Higuerota">mountains</placeName>, in the white blaze of noon, in the stillness and solitude of that <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#overgrownPieceOfLand">overgrown piece of land</placeName> between the nearly closed oval of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbor">harbor</placeName> and the spacious semicircle of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">gulf</placeName>, open broadly to the vast ocean. He lay as if dead. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#reyZamuro">A rey-zamuro</rs>, appearing like a tiny black speck in the blue, stooped, circling prudently with a stealthiness of flight startling in a bird of that great size. The shadow of his pearly-white body, of his black-tipped wings, fell on the grass no more silently than he alighted himself on a hillock of rubbish within three yards of that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">man</rs>, lying as still as a corpse. He stretched his bare neck, craned his bald head, loathsome in the brilliance of varied colouring, with an air of voracious anxiety towards the promising stillness of that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">prostrate body</rs>. Then, sinking his head deeply into his soft plumage, he settled himself to wait. The first thing upon which <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s eyes fell on waking was this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#reyZamuro">patient watcher</rs> for the signs of death and corruption. When the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">man</rs> got up the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#reyZamuro">vulture</rs> hopped away in great, side-long, fluttering jumps. He lingered for a while, morose and reluctant, before he rose, circling noiselessly with a sinister droop of beak and claws.</p> 
            <p>Long after he had vanished the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">Cargadores</rs></rs>, lifting his eyes up to the sky, muttered, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I am not dead yet."</said></p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> was some time in regaining his hold on the world. It had slipped from him completely in the deep slumber of more than twelve hours. It had been like a break of continuity in the chain of experience; he had to find himself in time and space, to think of the hour and the place of his return. It was a novelty. He was one of those efficient sailors who generally wake up from a dead sleep with their wits in complete working order. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">Cargadores</rs></rs> had been a good man on board ship. He had been a good foremast hand and a first-rate boatswain. That sort of excellence carries its own reward of satisfied vanity. From the conditions of sea life it brings no prize but an exaggerated consciousness of one's value and the confidence of one's superiors. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GeoneseCaptain">captain of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GeoneseCaptain">Genoese ship</placeName></rs> from which he had deserted had gone about tearing his grey hairs with grief and exasperation. He mingled imprecations against ingratitude with words of regret at his loss before the people on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName>, before the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#lightermen">lightermen</rs> discharging the cargo; in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN">O.S.N. office</placeName> before <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, who was sympathetic in a way, but considered him in the end an awful and ridiculous nuisance, and was glad to see his back for the last time.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, in close hiding in a back room of a <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#pulperia">pulperia</placeName> for the three days before the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GeoneseShip">ship</placeName> sailed, heard of these lamentations, threats, and curses apparently unmoved. But he heard of them with satisfaction. This was as it should be. He was a valuable man. What better recognition could he expect? His vanity was infinitely and naively greedy, but his conceptions were limited. Afterwards his success in the work he found on shore enlarged them<cb n="826.263.2"/> in the direction of personal magnificence. This <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">sailor</rs> led a public life in his sphere. It became necessary to him. It was the very breath of his nostrils. And who can say that it was not genuine distinction? It was genuine because it was based on something that was in him -- his overweening vanity, which <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs> alone, thinking that he would be of use politically, had taken the trouble to find out. Each man must have some temperamental sense by which to discover himself. With <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> it was vanity of an artless sort. It called out his recklessness, his industry, his ingenuity, and that disdain of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#natives">natives</rs> which helped him so much upon the line of his work and resembled an inborn capacity for command. It made him appear incorruptible and fierce. It made him happy also. He was pleased with himself. It was not the cold, ferocious, and idealistic self-conceit of a man of some northern race; it was materialistic and imaginative. It was an unpractical and warm sentiment, a picturesque development of his character, the growth of an unsophisticated sense of his individuality. It was immense. It was fostered by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>'s absurd pride in <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">his foreman <!-- "his" refers to Mitchell --></rs>, the varied use made of his handiness, and the appreciative grunts and nods of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">silent old Viola</rs>, to whose exalted sentiments every sort of faithfulness appealed greatly.</p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores"><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> Cargadores</rs></rs> had lived in splendour and publicity up to the very moment, as it were, when he took charge of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</placeName> containing the treasure in silver ingots.</p> 
            <p>The last act he had performed in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> was in complete harmony with his vanity, and as such perfectly genuine. He had given his last dollar to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villager">an old woman</rs> moaning with the grief and fatigue of a dismal search under the arch of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoGate">ancient gate</placeName>. Performed in obscurity and without witnesses, it had still the characteristic of splendour and publicity, and was in strict keeping with his reputation. But this awakening, in solitude but for the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#reyZamuro">watchful vulture</rs>, amongst the ruins of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldFort">fort</placeName> had no such characteristics. His first confused feeling was exactly this -- that it was not in keeping. It was more like the end of things.</p> 
            <p>He climbed the crumbling slope of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldFort">rampart</placeName>, and, putting aside the bushes, looked upon the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>. He saw a couple of ships at anchor upon the sheet of water reflecting the last gleams of light and <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloShip"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>'s steamer</placeName> moored to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#jetty">jetty</placeName>. And behind the pale long front of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Custom House</placeName> there appeared the extent of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> like a grove of thick timber on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plain">plain</placeName> with a <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoGate">gateway</placeName> in front, and the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoCupolas">cupolas</placeName> and <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoMiradors">miradors of churches</placeName> rising above the trees, all dark, as if surrendered already to the night. The thought that it was no longer open to him to ride through the streets, recognised by everyone, great and little, as he used to do every evening on his way to play monte in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#DomingoPosada">posada of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DomingoMexican">Mexican Domingo</rs></placeName>, or, sitting in the place of honour, to listen to songs and look at dances, made it appear to him as a town that had no existence.</p> 
            <p>For a long time he gazed on, then let the parted bushes spring back, and, crossing over to the other side of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldFort">fort</placeName>, surveyed the vaster emptiness of<cb n="826.263.3"/> the great <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">gulf</placeName>. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Isabels">Isabels</placeName> stood out heavily upon the narrowing long band of red in the west, which gleamed low between their black shapes, and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> thought of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs> alone there with the treasure. That <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">man</rs> was the only one who cared whether he fell into the hands of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monterists">Monterists</rs> or not, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> reflected bitterly. And that merely would be an anxiety for his own sake. As to the rest, they neither knew nor cared. What he had heard <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Giorgio Viola</rs> say once was very true. Kings, ministers, the aristocrats, the rich in general, kept the people in poverty and subjection; they kept them as they kept dogs, to fight and hunt for their service.</p> 
            <p>The darkness of the sky had descended to the line of the horizon, enveloping the whole <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">gulf</placeName>, the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Isabels">islets</placeName>, and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">lover of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs></rs> alone with the treasure on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">Great Isabel</placeName>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">Cargadores</rs></rs>, turning his back on these things invisible and existing, sat down and took his face between his fists. He felt the pinch of poverty for the first time in his life.</p> 
            <p>His mouth was dry. It was dry with heavy sleep and extremely anxious thinking, as it had never been dry before. It may be said that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> tasted the dust and ashes of the fruit of life into which he had bitten deeply in his hunger for praise. Without removing his head from between his fists he tried to spit before him -- <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Tfui"</said> -- and muttered a curse upon the selfishness of all the rich people.</p> 
            <p>In this <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> at the foot of immense <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Higuerota">mountains</placeName> that outlined their shadowy peaks amongst the kindled swarm of stars, on this smooth, half-wild sheet of black water serene in its loneliness, whose future of crowded prosperity was being settled not so much by the industry as by the fears and necessities and crimes of men, short-sighted in good and evil, the two solitary foreign ships had hoisted their riding lights according to rule. But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> gave no second look to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>. Those two ships were present enough to his mind. Either would have been a refuge. It would have been no feat for him to swim off to them. One of them was <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#ItalianShip">an Italian barque</placeName> which had brought a cargo of timber from <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#PugetSound">Puget Sound</placeName> for the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway</placeName>. He knew <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ItalianShipMen">her men</rs>; in his quality of foreman of all the work done in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> he had been able to oblige <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ItalianShipCaptain">her captain</rs> in some small matter relating to the filling of his water tanks. Bronzed, black-whiskered, and stately, with the impressive gravity of a man too powerful to unbend in a smile, he had been invited more than once to drink a glass of Italian vermouth in her <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#ItalianShip">cabin</placeName>. It was well known amongst ship-masters trading along the seaboard that as a matter of sound policy the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">Cargadores</rs> in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName></rs> should be propitiated by small civilities, which, as a matter of fact, he seemed to expect as his due. For in truth, being implicitly trusted by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, he had, as somebody said, the whole <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> in his pocket. For the rest, an excellent fellow, quite straightforward, everybody agreed.</p>

            <head>CHAPTER VIII. (continued)</head>
            <p>Since everything seemed lost in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> (and that was the feeling of his waking as if from a dream come to a sudden end), the idea of leaving the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaugana">country</placeName> altogether had presented itself to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>. In that <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#ItalianShip">ship</placeName> they would have given him shelter and a passage, and have landed him in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Italy">Italy</placeName> ultimately. At that thought he had seen, like the beginning of another dream, a vision of green and tideless shores, with dark pines on the heights and white houses low down near a very blue sea. He saw the quays of a big port, where the coasting feluccas, with their lateen sails outspread like motionless wings, enter gliding silently between the end of long moles of squared blocks that project angularly toward each other, hugging a duster of shipping to the superb bosom of a hill covered with palaces.</p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">renowned Capataz,</rs> his elbows on his knees and a fist dug into each cheek, laughed with self-derision, as he had spat with disgust, straight out before him into the night. The confused and intimate impressions of universal dissolution which beset a subjective nature at any strong check to its ruling passion had a bitterness approaching that of death itself. And no wonder -- with no intellectual existence or moral strain to carry on his individuality, unscathed, over the abyss left by the collapse of his vanity; for even that had been simply sensuous and picturesque, and could not exist apart from outward show.</p> 
            <p>The facts of his situation he could appreciate like a man with a distinct experience of the country. He saw them clearly. He was as if sobered after a long bout of intoxication. His fidelity had been taken advantage of. He had persuaded the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">body of Cargadores</rs> to side with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Blancos">Blancos</rs> against the rest of the people; he had had interviews with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#JoseDon">Don José</rs>; he had been made use of by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CorbelanFather">Father Corbelàn</rs> for negotiating with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs>; it was known that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Don Martin Decoud</rs> had admitted him to a sort of intimacy, so that he had been free of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Provernir">offices of the "Porvenir."</placeName> All these things had flattered him in the usual way. What did he care about their politics? Nothing at all. And at the end of it all -- <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> here and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> there. Where is <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>? <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> can do this and that -- work all day and ride about at night. Lo and behold! he found himself a marked Ribierist for any sort of vengeance <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs>, for instance, would choose to take, now the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monterists">Montero party</rs> had, after all, mastered the accursed <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CostaguanaEuropeans">Europeans</rs> had given<cb n="92.293.2"/> up; the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#caballeros">Caballeros</rs> had given up. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Don Martin</rs> had indeed explained it was only temporary -- that he was going to bring <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs> to the rescue. Where was that now -- with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Don Martin</rs> (whose ironic manner of talk had always made the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> feel vaguely uneasy) stranded on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">Great Isabel</placeName>? Everybody had given up. Even <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs> had given up. The hurried removal of the treasure out to sea meant nothing else than that. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">Cargadores</rs></rs>, in a revulsion of subjectiveness, exasperated almost to insanity, beheld all his world without faith and courage. He had been betrayed!</p> 
            <p>With the boundless shadows of the sea behind him, out of his silence and immobility, facing the lofty shadows of the lower peaks crowded around the white, misty sheen of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Higuerota">Higuerota</placeName>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> laughed aloud again, sprang abruptly to his feet, and stood still. He must go. But where?</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"There is no mistake. Like dogs to fight and hunt for them. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">vecchio</rs> is right,"</said> he said, slowly and scathingly. He remembered <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Giorgio</rs> taking his pipe out of his mouth to throw these words over his shoulders at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">café</placeName>, full of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayWorkers">engine-drivers and fitters</rs> from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway workshops</placeName>. This image fixed his wavering purpose. He would try to find <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Giorgio</rs> if he could. God knows what might have happened to him! He made a few steps, then stopped again and shook his head. To the left and right in front and behind him, the scrubby bush rustled mysteriously in the darkness.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">Teresa</rs> was right, too,"</said> he added in a low tone touched with awe, and lingered. He wondered whether she were dead in her anger with him or still alive. As if in answer to this thought, half of remorse and half of hope, with a soft flutter and oblique flight <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#owl">a big owl</rs>, whose appalling cry: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#owl">"Ya-acabo! Ya-acabo!"</said> -- it is finished; it is finished -- in the popular belief announces calamity and death, drifted vaguely like a large dark ball across his path. In the downfall of all the realities that made his force, he was affected by the superstition, and shuddered slightly. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">Signora Teresa</rs> must have died then. It could mean nothing else.</p> 
            <p>As to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, after the manner of trusted subordinates, considered him as a person fitted by education perhaps to sign papers in an office and to give orders, but otherwise of no use whatever, and something of a fool. The necessity of winding round his little finger almost daily the pompous and testy self-importance of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">old seaman</rs> had grown irksome with use to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>. At first it had given him an inward satisfaction. But the necessity of overcoming small obstacles<cb n="92.293.3"/> becomes wearisome to a self-confident personality as much by the certitude of success as by the monotony of effort. He mistrusted <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">his superior <!-- "his" refers to Nostromo --></rs>'s proneness to fussy action. That <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">old Englishman</rs> had no judgment he said to himself. It was useless to suppose that, acquainted with the true state of the case, he would keep it to himself. He would talk of doing impracticable things. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> feared him as one would fear saddling oneself with some persistent worry. He had no discretion. He would betray the treasure. And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> had made up his mind that the treasure should not be betrayed.</p> 
            <p>The word had fixed itself tenaciously in his unintelligence. His imagination had seized upon the clear and simple notion of betrayal to account for the dazed feeling of enlightenment as to being done for, of having inadvertently gone out of his existence on an issue in which his personality had not been taken into account. A man betrayed is a man destroyed. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">Signora Teresa</rs> (may God have her soul!) had been right. He had never been taken into account. Destroyed! Her white form sitting up bowed in bed, the falling black hair, the wide-browed suffering face raised to him the anger of her denunciations, appeared to him now majestic with the awfulness of inspiration and of death. For it was not for nothing that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#owl">evil bird</rs> had uttered its lamentable shriek over his head. She was dead -- may God have her soul!</p> 
            <p>Sharing in the anti-priestly freethought of the masses, his mind used the pious formula from the superficial force of habit but with a deep-seated sincerity. The popular mind is incapable of scepticism; and that incapacity delivers their helpless strength to the wiles of swindlers and to the pitiless enthusiasms of leaders inspired by visions of a high destiny. She was dead. But would God consent to receive her soul? She had died without confession or absolution, because he had not been willing to spare her another moment of his time. His scorn of priests as priests remained; but, after all, it was impossible to know whether what they affirmed was not true. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">magnificent Capataz of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">Cargadores</rs></rs>, deprived of certain simple realities, such as the admiration of women, the adulation of men, the admired publicity of his life was ready to feel the burden of sacrilegious guilt descend upon his shoulders. 
                Bareheaded, in a thin shirt and drawers, he felt the lingering warmth of the fine sand under the soles of his feet. The narrow strand gleamed far ahead in long curve defining the outline of this wild side of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>. He flitted along the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#shore">shore</placeName> like a pursued<cb n="92.294.1"/><pb n="294"/> shadow between the sombre palm groves and the sheet of water lying as still as death on his right hand. He strode with headlong haste in the silence and solitude, as though he had forgotten all prudence and caution. But he knew that on <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#oppositeHarbour serOgraphies.xml#oldFort">this side of the water</placeName> he ran no risk of discovery. The only inhabitant was a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#IndianApathetic">lonely, silent, apathetic Indian</rs> in charge of the <placeName ref="serOgrphies.xml#palmarias">palmarias</placeName>, who brought sometimes a load of cocoa-nuts to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> for sale. He lived without a woman in an <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#IndianApatheticHouse">open shed</placeName> with a perpetual fire of dry sticks smouldering in front near an old canoe lying bottom up on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#oppositeHarbour">beach</placeName>. He could be easily avoided.</p> 
            <p>The barking of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#IndianApatheticDogs">dogs</rs> about that <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#IndianApatheticRanche"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#IndianApathetic">man</rs>'s ranche</placeName> was the first thing that checked his speed. He had forgotten the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#IndianApatheticDogs">dogs</rs>. He swerved sharply and plunged into the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#palmaria">palm grove</placeName> as into a wilderness of columns in an immense hall, whose dense obscurity seemed to whisper and rustle faintly high above his head. He traversed it, entered a ravine, climbed free of bushes to the top of a steep ridge.</p> 
            <p>From there, open and vague in the starlight, he saw the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plain">plain between the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> and the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName></placeName>. In the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldFortWoods">woods</placeName> above some <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#nightBird">night-bird</rs> made a strange drumming noise. Below, beyond the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#palmaria">palmaria</placeName> on the <placeName ref="SerOgraphies.xml#oppositeHarbour">beach</placeName>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#IndianApatheticDogs">Indians' dogs</rs> continued to bark uproariously. He wondered what had upset them so much, and, peering down from his elevation, was surprised to detect unaccountable movements of the ground below, as if several oblong pieces of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plain">plain</placeName> had been in motion. Those dark, shifting patches, alternately catching and eluding the eye, altered their place always away from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>, with a suggestion of consecutive order and purpose. A light dawned upon him. It was a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">column of infantry</rs> on a night march towards the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#higherBrokenCountry">higher broken country at the foot of the hills</placeName>. But he was too much in the dark about everything for wonder and speculation. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plain">plain</placeName> had resumed its shadowy immobility. He descended the ridge and found himself in the open solitude, between the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> and the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>. Its spaciousness, extended indefinitely by an effect of obscurity, rendered more sensible his profound isolation. His pace became slower. No one waited for him; no one thought of him; no one expected or wished his return. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Betrayed! Betrayed!"</said> he muttered to himself. No one cared. He might have been drowned by this time. No one would have cared -- unless, perhaps, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">children</rs>, he thought to himself. But they were with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">English sigñora</rs> and not thinking of him at all.</p>
            <p>He wavered in his purpose of making straight for the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">Casa Viola</placeName>. To what end? What could he expect there? His life seemed to fail him in all its details, even to the scornful reproaches of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">Teresa</rs>. He was aware painfully of his reluctance. Was it that remorse which she had prophesied with, what he saw now, was her last breath?</p>
            <p>Meantime he had deviated from the straight course, inclining by a sort of instinct to the left, towards the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#jetty">jetty</placeName> and the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>, the scene of his daily labours. The great length of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Custom-house</placeName> loomed up all at once like the wall of a factory. Not a soul challenged his approach, and his curiosity became excited as he passed cautiously<cb n="92.294.2"/> towards the front by the unexpected sight of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">two lighted windows</placeName>.</p> 
            <p>They had the fascination of a lonely vigil kept by some mysterious watcher up there, those <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">two windows</placeName> shining dimly upon the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> in the whole vast extent of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">abandoned building</placeName>. The solitude could almost be felt. A strong smell of wood smoke hung about in a thin haze which was faintly perceptible to his raised eyes against the glitter of the stars. As he advanced in the profound silence, tensely on the alert, the shrilling of innumerable cicalas in the dry grass seemed positively deafening to his strained ears. Slowly, step by step, he found himself in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">great hall</placeName>, sombre and full of acrid smoke.</p> 
            <p>A fire built against the staircase had burnt down impotently to a low heap of embers. The hard wood had failed to catch; only a few steps at the bottom smouldered, with a creeping glow of sparks defining their charred edges. At the top he saw a streak of light from an open door. It fell upon the vast <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">landing</placeName>, all foggy with a slow drift of smoke. That was the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName>. He climbed the stairs, then checked himself, because he had seen within the shadow of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">a man</rs> cast upon one of the walls. It was a shapeless, high-shouldered shadow of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">somebody</rs> standing still, with a lowered head, out of his line of sight. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>, remembering that he was totally unarmed, stepped aside, and, effacing himself upright in a dark corner, waited, his eyes fixed on the door.</p> 
            <p>The whole enormous <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">ruined barrack of a place</placeName>, unfinished, without ceilings under its lofty roof, was pervaded by smoke swaying to and fro in the faint cross draughts playing in the vast obscurity of many lofty rooms and barn-like passages. Once one of the swinging shutters came against the wall with a single sharp crack, as if pushed by an impatient hand. A piece of paper scurried out from somewhere, rustling along the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">landing</placeName>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">man</rs>, whoever he was, did not darken the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">lighted doorway</placeName>. Twice the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>, advancing a couple of steps out of his corner, craned his neck in the hope of catching sight of what he would be at so quietly in there. But every time he saw only the distorted shadow of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">broad shoulders and bowed head</rs>. He was doing apparently nothing, and stirred not from the spot, as though he were meditating -- or perhaps he was reading a paper. And not a sound issued from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName>.</p> 
            <p>Once more the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</placeName> stepped back. He wondered who it was -- <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">some Monterist?</rs> But he dreaded to show himself. To discover his presence on shore, unless after many days, would, he believed, endanger the treasure. With his own knowledge possessing his whole soul it seemed impossible that anybody in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> should fail to jump at the right surmise. After a couple of weeks or so it would be different. Who could tell he had not returned overland from some port beyond the limits of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Republic</placeName>? The existence of the treasure confused his thoughts with a peculiar sort of anxiety, as though his life had become bound up with it. It rendered him timorous for a moment before that <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">enigmatic lighted door</placeName>. Devil take the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">fellow</rs>! He did not want to see him. There would be nothing to learn from his face, known or unknown. He was a fool to waste his time there in waiting.</p><cb n="92.294.3"/> 
            <p>Less than five minutes after entering the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">place</placeName> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> began his retreat. He got away down the stairs with perfect success, gave one upward look over his shoulder at the light on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">landing</placeName>, and ran stealthily across the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">hall</placeName>. But at the very moment he was turning out of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">great door</placeName> with his mind fixed upon escaping the notice of the man upstairs, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">somebody he had not heard</rs> coming briskly along the front ran full into him. Both muttered a stifled exclamation of surprise, and leaped back and stood still, each indistinct to the other. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> was silent. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">other man <!-- other to Nostromo --></rs> spoke first, in an amazed and deadened tone.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Who are you?"</said></p> 
            <p>Already <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> had seemed to recognise <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>. He had no doubt now. He hesitated the space of a second. The idea of bolting without a word presented itself to his mind. No use! An inexplicable repugnance to pronounce <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">the name by which he was known</rs> kept him silent a little longer. At last he said in a low voice,</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">A Cargador</rs>."</said></p>  
            <p>He walked up to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">other <!-- other to Nostromo --></rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> had received a shock. He flung his arms up and cried out his wonder aloud, forgetting himself before the marvel of this meeting. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> angrily bid him moderate his voice.</p>
            <p>There is no more evanescent quality in an accomplished fact than its wonderfulness. Solicited incessantly by the considerations affecting its fears and desires the human mind turns naturally away from the marvellous side of events. And it, was in the most natural way possible that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> asked this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">man</rs>, whom only two minutes before he believed to have been drowned in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">gulf</placeName>,</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"You have seen somebody up there? Have you?"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"No I have not seen him"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Then how do you know?"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I was running away from his shadow when we met."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"His shadow?"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="SerOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Yes. His shadow in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">lighted room</placeName>,"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, in a contemptuous tone. Leaning back with folded arms at the foot of the immense <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">building</placeName>, he dropped his head, biting his lips slightly, and not looking at the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Now,"</said> he thought to himself, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"he will begin asking me about the treasure."</said></p> 
            <p>But the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>'s thoughts were concerned with an event not as marvellous as <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s re-appearance, but in itself much less clear. Why had <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> taken himself off with his whole command with this suddenness and secrecy? What did this move portend? However, it dawned upon the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">man upstairs</rs> was one of the officers left behind by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">disappointed colonel</rs> to communicate with him.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I believe he is waiting for me,"</said> he said.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"It is possible.</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I must see. Do not go away yet, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Go away, where?"</said> muttered <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>.</p>
            <p>Already the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> had left him. He remained leaning against the wall, staring at the dark water of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>; the shrilling of cicalas filled his ears. An invincible vagueness coming over his thoughts took from them all power to determine his well.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>! <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>!"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>'s voice called urgently from above.</p><cb n="92.295.1"/><pb n="295"/>
            <p>The sense of betrayal and ruin floated upon his sombre indifference as upon a sluggish sea of pitch. But he stepped out from under the wall, and, looking up, saw <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> leaning out of a <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">lighted window</placeName>.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Come up and see what <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> has done. You need not fear the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">man up here</rs>."</said></p> 
            <p>He answered by a slight bitter laugh. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Fear a man! The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores"><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> Cargadores</rs></rs> fear a man!"</said> It angered him that anybody should suggest such a thing. It angered him to be disarmed and skulking and in danger because of the accursed treasure which was of so little account to the people who had tied it round his neck. He could not shake off the worry of it. To <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> represented all these people... And he had never even asked after it. Not a word of inquiry about the most desperate undertaking of his life.</p> 
            <p>Thinking these thoughts <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> passed again through the cavernous <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">hall</placeName> where the smoke was considerably thinned, and again went up the stairs, not so warm to his feet now, towards the streak of light at the top. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> appeared in it for a moment, agitated and impatient.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Come up! Come up!"</said> At the moment of crossing the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">doorway</placeName> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> experienced a shock of surprise. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">man</rs> had not moved. He saw his shadow in the same place. He started, then stepped in with a feeling of being about to solve a mystery. It was very simple. For an infinitesimal fraction of a second, against the light of two flaring and guttering candles, through a blue, pungent, thin haze which made his eyes smart, he saw the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">man</rs> standing, as he had imagined him, with his back to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">door</placeName>, casting an enormous and distorted shadow upon the wall. Swifter than a flash of lightning followed the impression of his constrained, toppling attitude -- the shoulders projected forward, the head sunk low upon the breast. Then he distinguished the arms behind his back, and wrenched so terribly that the two clenched fists, lashed together, had been forced up higher than the shoulderblades. From there his eyes traced in one instantaneous glance the hide rope going upwards from the tied wrists over a heavy beam and down to a staple in the wall. He did not want to look at the rigid legs, at the feet hanging down nervelessly, with their bare toes some six inches above the floor, to know that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">man</rs> had been given the estrapade till he had swooned. His first impulse was to dash forward and sever the rope at one blow. He felt for his knife. He had no knife -- not even a knife. He stood quivering, and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, perched on the edge of the table, facing thoughtfully the cruel and lamentable sight, his chin in his hand, uttered, without stirring:</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Tortured -- and shot dead through the breast -- getting cold."</said></p>    
            <p>This information calmed the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>. One of the candles flickering in the socket went out. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Who did this?"</said> he asked.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, I tell you. Who else? Tortured -- of course. But why shot?"</said> The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> looked fixedly at <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, who shrugged his shoulder slightly. <said>"And mark, shot suddenly, on impulse. It is evident. I wish I had his secret."</said></p><cb n="92.295.2"/> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> had advanced and stooped slightly to look. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I seem to have seen that face somewhere,"</said> he muttered. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Who is he?"</said> The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> turned his eyes upon him again. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I may yet come to envying his fate. What do you think of that, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>, eh?"</said></p> 
            <p>But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> did not even hear these words. Seizing the remaining light, he thrust it under the drooping head. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> sat oblivious, with a lost gaze. When the heavy iron candlestick, as if struck out of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s hand, clattered on the floor. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Hullo!"</said> exclaimed the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, looking up with a start. He could hear the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> stagger against the table and gasp. In the sudden extinction of the light within, the dead blackness sealing the window-frames became alive with stars to his sight.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Of course, of course,"</said> he muttered to himself in English. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Enough to make him jump out of his skin."</said></p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s heart seemed to force itself into his throat. His head swam. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Hirsch</rs>! The man was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Hirsch</rs>! He held on tight to the edge of the table.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">"But he was hiding in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</placeName>,"</said> he almost shouted. His voice fell. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"In the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</placeName>, and -- and --"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> brought him in,"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"He is no more startling to you than you were to me. What I want to know is how he induced some compassionate soul to shoot him."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"So <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> knows --"</said> began <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, in a more equable voice.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Everything!"</said> interrupted the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>.</p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> was heard striking the table with his fist.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Everything? What are you saying, there? Everything? Know everything? It is impossible! Everything?"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Of course. What do you mean by impossible? I tell you I have heard him questioned last night, here, in this very <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName>. He knew your name, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>'s name, and all about the loading of the silver.. <!-- sic --> The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</placeName> was cut in two. He was grovelling in abject terror before <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, but he remembered that much. What do you want more? He knew least about himself. They found him clinging to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloShip">their anchor</placeName>. He must have caught at it just as the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</rs> went to the bottom."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Went to the bottom?"</said> repeated <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, slowly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> believes that? Bueno!"</said></p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, a little impatiently, was unable to imagine what else could anybody believe. Yes, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> believed that the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</placeName> was sunk, and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">Cargadores</rs></rs>, together with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Martin Decoud</rs> and perhaps one or two other political fugitives, had been drowned.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I told you well, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Señor Doctor</rs>,"</said> remarked <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> at that point, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> did not know everything."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Eh? What do you mean?"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"He did not know I was not dead."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Neither did we."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"And you did not care -- none of you <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#caballerosOnTheWharf">caballeros on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#whard">wharf</placeName></rs> -- once you got off a man of flesh and blood like yourselves on a fool's business that could not end well."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"You forget, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>, I was not on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName>. And I did not think well of the business. So you need not taunt me; I tell you what, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">man</rs>, we had but little leisure to think of the dead.

            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I went, indeed!"</said> broke in <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"And for the sake of what -- tell me?"</said></p><cb n="92.295.3"/>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Ah! that is your own affair,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> said roughly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Do not ask me."</said></p> 
            <p>Their flowing murmurs paused in the dark. Perched on the edge of the table they faced each other with slightly averted faces, and their eyes remained directed towards <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">an upright shape nearly lost in the obscurity</rs> of the inner part of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName>, that with projecting head and shoulders in ghastly immobility seemed intent on catching every word.

            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">Teresa</rs> is dead,"</said> remarked the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> absently, while his mind followed a new line of thought suggested by what might have been called <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s return to life. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"She died, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">poor woman</rs>."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Without a priest?"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> asked anxiously.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"What a question! Who could have got a priest for her last night?"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"May God have her soul!"</said> ejaculated <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, with a sort of gloomy and hopeless fervour which had no time to surprise <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> before, reverting to their previous conversation, he continued in a sinister tone, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Si, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Señor doctor</rs>. As you were saying, it is my own affair. A very desperate affair."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"There are no two men in this part of the world that could have saved themselves by swimming as you have done,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> said admiringly.</p> 
            <p>And again there was silence between those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">two men</rs>. They were both reflecting, and the diversity of their natures made their thoughts born from their meeting swing afar from each other. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, impelled to rising action by his loyalty to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Goulds">Goulds</rs>, wondered with thankfulness at the chain of accident which had brought that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">man</rs> back where he would be of the greatest use in the work of saving the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> was loyal to the <placeName ref="sreOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName>. It presented itself to his fifty-years old eyes in the shape of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">a little woman</rs> in a soft dress with a long train, with a head attractively overweighted by a great mass of fair hair and the delicate preciousness of her inner worth, partaking of a gem and a flower, revealed in every attitude of her person. As the dangers thickened round the  <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName> this illusion acquired force, permanency, and authority. It claimed him at last! This claim, exalted by a spiritual detachment from the usual sanctions of hope and reward, made <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>'s thinking, acting individuality extremely dangerous to himself and to others, all his scruples vanishing in the proud feeling that his devotion was the only thing that stood between <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">an admirable woman</rs> and a frightful disaster.</p> 
            <p>It was a sort of intoxication which made him utterly indifferent to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>'s fate, but left his wits perfectly clear for the appreciation of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>'s political idea. It was a good idea -- and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs> was the only instrument of its realisation. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>'s soul, withered and struck by the shame of a moral disgrace, became implacable in the expan<cb n="99.325.2"/>sion of its tenderness. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s return was providential. He did not think of him humanely as of a fellow-creature just escaped from the jaws of death. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> for him was the only possible messenger to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Cayta">Cayta</placeName>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">The very man <!-- unsure whether or not to tag "the very man" as an epithet --></rs>.</p>
            <p>On <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s side the silence had been full of black irresolution, anger and mistrust. He was the first to break it, however.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"The swimming was no great matter,</said> he said. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"It is what went before -- and what comes after that --"</said></p>
            <p>He did not quite finish what he meant to say, breaking off short, as though his thought had butted against a solid obstacle. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>'s mind pursued its own schemes with Machiavellian subtlety. He said as sympathetically as he was able,</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"It is unfortunate, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>. But no one would think of blaming you. Very unfortunate. To begin with, the treasure ought never to have left the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mountain</placeName>. But it was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs> who -- however, he is dead. There is no need to talk of him."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"No,"</said> assented <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, as the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> paused, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"there is no need to talk of dead men. But I am not dead yet."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"You are all right. Only a man of your intrepidity could have saved himself."</said></p> 
            <p>In this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> was sincere. He esteemed highly the intrepidity of that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">man</rs>, whom he valued but little, being disillusioned as to mankind in general, because of the particular instance in which his own manhood had failed. He was eminently fit to appreciate the mental image he made for himself of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> after hours of tension and anxiety precipitated suddenly into an abyss of waters and darkness, without earth or sky, and confronting it not only with an undismayed mind but with sensible success. Of course, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">man</rs> was an incomparable swimmer, that was known, but the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> judged that this instance testified to a still greater intrepidity of spirit. It was pleasing to him; he augured well from it for the success of the arduous mission with which he meant to entrust the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> so marvellously restored to usefulness. And in a tone vaguely gratified, he observed,</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"It must have been terribly dark!"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"It was the worst darkness of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">Golfo</placeName>,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> assented briefly. He was mollified by what seemed a sign of some faint interest in such things as had befallen him, and dropped a few descriptive phrases with an affected and curt nonchalance. At that moment he felt communicative. He expected the continuance of that interest which, whether accepted or rejected, would have restored to him his personality -- the only thing lost in that desperate<cb n="99.325.3"/> affair. But the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, engrossed by a desperate adventure of his own, was terrible in the pursuit of his idea. He let an exclamation of regret escape him.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I could almost wish you had shouted and shown a light."</said></p>
            <p>The unexpected utterance astounded the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> by its character of cold-blooded atrocity. It was as much as to say, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I wish you had had your throat cut for you pains." <!-- Nostromo's interpretation of what Monygham said. I am unsure how to tag this. --></said> Naturally he referred it to himself, whereas it related only to the silver, being uttered simply and with many mental reservations. Surprise and rage rendered him speechless, and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> pursued, practically unheard by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, whose stirred blood was beating violently in his ears.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"For I am convinced <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> in possession of the silver would have turned short round and made for some small port abroad. Economically it would have been wasteful, but still less wasteful than having it sunk. It was the next best thing to having it at hand in some safe place and using part of it to buy up <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>. But I doubt whether <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs> would have ever made up his mind to it. He is not fit for <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName> and that is a fact, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>."</said></p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> had mastered <!-- no spaces, written "Capatazhadmastered" in serial --> the fury that was like a tempest in his ears, in time to hear the name of <rs ref="SerOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs>. He seemed to have come out of it a changed man -- a man who spoke thoughtfully in a soft and even voice.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"And would <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Do<!--a was the typo in the serial-->n Carlos</rs> have been content if I had surrendered this treasure?"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I should not wonder if they were all of that way of thinking now,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> said grimly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I was never consulted. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs> had it his own way. Their eyes are opened by this time, I should think. I for one know that if that silver turned up this moment miraculously ashore I would give it to him. And as things stand, I would be approved."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Turned up miraculously,"</said> repeated the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> very low; then raised his voice. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"That, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">señor</rs>, would be a greater miracle than any saint could perform."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I believe you, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>,"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> drily. He went on to develop his view of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>'s dangerous influence upon the situation. And the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>, listening as if in a dream, felt himself of as little account as the indistinct, motionless shape of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">dead man</rs> whom he saw upright under the beam, with his air of listening also, disregarded, forgotten, like a terrible example of neglect.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Is it for an unconsidered and foolish whim that they came to me, then?"</said> he interrupted, suddenly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Had I not done enough for them to be of some account, por Dios?

Or perhaps we have no souls -- like dogs?"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">"There was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>, too, with his plan."</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> reminded him again.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Si! And the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Holroyd">rich man in San Francisco</rs> who had something to do with that treasure, too -- what do I know? No! I have heard too many things. It seems to me that everything is permitted to the rich."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I understand, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> began.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"What <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>?"</said> broke in <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> in a forcible but even voice. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> is undone, destroyed.

            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Come, this is childish,"</said> remonstrated the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>; and the other calmed down suddenly.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I have been indeed like a little child,"</said> he muttered.</p>
            <p>And as his eyes met again the shape of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">murdered man</rs> suspended in his awful immobility, which seemed the uncomplaining immobility of attention, he asked, wondering gently:</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Why did <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> give the estrapade to this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">pitiful wretch</rs>? Do you know? No torture could have been worse than his fear. Killing I can understand. His anguish was intolerable to behold. But why should he torment him like this? He could tell no more."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"No. He could tell nothing more. Any sane man would have seen that. He had told him everything. But I tell you what it is, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> would not believe what he was told. Not everything."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"What is it he would not believe? I cannot understand."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I can, because I have seen the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">man</rs>. He refuses to believe that the treasure is lost."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"What?"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> cried out in a discomposed tone.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"That startles you -- eh?"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Am I to understand <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">señor</rs>,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> went on in a deliberate and, as it were, watchful tone, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> thinks the treasure has been saved by some means?"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"No! no! That would be impossible,"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> with conviction, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> emitted a grunt in the dark. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"That would be impossible. He thinks that the silver was no longer in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</placeName> when she was sunk. He has convinced himself that the whole show of getting it away to sea is a mere sham got up to deceive <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard">his Nationals</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Señor Fuentes</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">our new Gefe Politico</rs>, and himself, too. Only, he says, he is no such fool."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"But he is devoid of sense. He is the greatest imbecile that ever called himself <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">a colonel</rs> in this <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country of evil</placeName>,"</said> growled <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"He is no more unreasonable than many sensible men,"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"He has convinced himself that the treasure can be found because he desires passionately to possess himself of it. And he is also afraid of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">his officers</rs> turning upon him and going over to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs>, whom he has not the courage either to fight or trust. Do you see that, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>? That is not to be feared as long as some hope remains of that enormous plunder turning up. I have made it my business to keep this hope up."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"You have!"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz de <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">Cargadores</rs></rs> repeated cautiously. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Well, that is wonderful. And how long do you think you are going to keep it up?"</said></p><cb n="99.326.2"/>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"As long as I can."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"What does that mean?"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I can tell you exactly. As long as I live,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> retorted in a stubborn tone. Then in a few words he described the story of his arrest and the circumstances of his release. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I was going back to that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">silly scoundrel</rs> when we met,"</said> he concluded. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> had listened with profound attention.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"You have made up your mind, then, to a speedy death,"</said> he muttered through his clenched teeth.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Perhaps, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">my illustrious Capataz</rs>,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> said testily. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"You are not the only one here who can look an ugly death in the face."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"No doubt,"</said> mumbled <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, loud enough to be overheard. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"There may be even more than two fools in this place. Who knows?"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"And that is my affair,"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> curtly.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"As taking out the accursed silver to sea was my affair,"</said> retorted <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I see. Bueno. Each of us has his reasons. But you were the last man I conversed with before I started, and you talked to me as if I were a fool."</said></p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> had a great distaste for the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>'s sardonic treatment of his great reputation. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>'s faintly ironic recognition used to make him uneasy; but the familiarity of a man like <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Don Martin</rs> was flattering, whereas the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> was a nobody.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"You may be very wise,"</said> he went on thoughtfully, staring into the obscurity of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName> pervaded by the gruesome enigma of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">tortured and murdered Hirsch</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"But I am not such a fool as when I started. I have learned one thing since, and that is that you are a dangerous man."</said></p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor Monygham</rs> was too startled to do more than exclaim:</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"What is it you say?"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"If he could speak he would say the same thing,"</said> pursued <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, with a nod of his shadowy head silhouetted against the starlit window.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I do not understand you,"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, faintly.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"No? Perhaps if you had not confirmed <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> in his madness he would have been in no hurry to give the estrapade to that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">miserable Hirsch</rs>."</said></p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> started at the suggestion. But his devotion, absorbing all his sensibilities, had left his heart steeled against remorse and pity. Still, for complete relief he felt the necessity of repelling it loudly and contemptuously.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Bah! You dare to tell me that, with a man like <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>. I confess I did not give a thought to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Hirsch</rs>. If I had it would have been useless. Anybody can see that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">luckless wretch</rs> was doomed from the moment he caught hold of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloShip">anchor</placeName>. He was doomed, I tell you! Just as I myself am doomed -- most probably."</said></p> 
            <p>This is what <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> said in answer to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s remark, which was plausible enough to prick his conscience. He was not a callous man. But the necessity, the magnitude, the importance of the task he had taken upon himself dwarfed all merely humane considerations. He had undertaken it in a fanatical spirit. He did not like it. To lie, to deceive, to circumvent even the basest of mankind was odious to him. It was odious to him by training, instinct, and tradition. To do these things in the character of<cb n="99.326.2"/> a traitor was abhorrent to his nature, and terrible to his feelings. He had made that sacrifice in a spirit of abasement. He had said to himself bitterly: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I am the only one fit for that dirty work."</said> And he believed this. He was not subtle. His simplicity was such that though he had no sort of heroic idea of seeking death, the risk, deadly enough, to which he exposed himself had a sustaining and comforting effect. To that spiritual state the fate of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Hirsch</rs> presented itself as part of the general atrocity of things. He considered that episode practically. What did it mean? Was it a sign of some dangerous change in <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>'s delusion? That the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">man</rs> should have been killed like this was what the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> could not understand.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Yes. But why shot?"</said> he murmured to himself.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> kept very still.</p></div> 
        <div type="chapter" n="3.9.326">
            <head>CHAPTER IX.</head> 
            <p>Distracted between doubts and hopes, dismayed by the sound of bells pealing out the arrival of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> had spent the morning in battling with his thoughts; a contest to which he was unequal, from the vacuity of his mind and the violence of his passions. Disappointment, greed, anger, and fear made a tumult in the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs>'s breast louder than the din of bells in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>. Nothing he had planned had come to pass. Neither <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> nor the silver of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName> had fallen into his hands. He had no exploit to secure his position, and no enormous booty to make off with. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs>, either as friend or foe, filled him with dread. The sound of bells maddened him.</p> 
            <p>Imagining at first that he might be attacked at once, he had made <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">his battalion</rs> stand to arms on the shore. He walked to and fro all the length of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName>, stopping sometimes to gnaw the finger-tips of his right hand with a lurid sideways glare fixed on the floor. His hat, horsewhip, sword, and revolver were lying on the table. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">His officers</rs>, all crowding in the window giving the view of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xmlSulacoGate">town gate</placeName>, disputed amongst themselves for the use of his field-glass bought last year on long credit from <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Anzani">Anzani</rs>. It passed from hand to hand, and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">possessor</rs> of it for the time being was besieged by anxious enquiries.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"There is nothing; there is nothing to see!"</said> he would repeat impatiently.</p> 
            <p>There was nothing. And when the picket in the bushes near the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">Casa Viola</placeName> had been ordered back upon the main body no stir of life appeared on the stretch of dusty and arid <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#betweenTownAndPort">land between the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> and the waters of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#port">port</placeName></placeName>. But late in the afternoon <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">a horseman</rs> issuing from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoGate">gate</placeName> was made out riding up fearlessly. It was an emissary from <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Señor Fuentes</rs>. Being all alone he was allowed to come on. Dismounting at the great door he greeted the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">silent bystanders</rs> with cheery impudence, and begged to be taken up at once to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"muy valliente" Colonel</rs>. 
                <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Señor Fuentes</rs> on entering upon his functions of Gefe Politico had turned his diplomatic abilities to getting hold of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> as well as of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">man</rs> he pitched upon to negotiate with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> was a Notary Public whom<cb n="99.327.1"/><pb n="327"/> the revolution had found languishing in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#commonJail">common jail</placeName> on a charge of forging documents. Liberated by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mob">mob</rs> along with the other <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BlancoVictims">victims of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Blancos">Blanco</rs> tyranny</rs>, he had hastened to offer his services to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monterists">new Government</rs>.</p> 
            <p>He set out determined to display much zeal and eloquence in trying to induce <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> to come into <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> alone for a conference with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs>. Nothing was further from the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs>'s intentions. The mere fleeting idea of thrusting himself into the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">famous Pedrito</rs>'s hands had made him feel unwell several times. It was out of the question -- it was madness. And to put himself in open hostility was madness, too. It would render impossible a systematic search for that treasure, for that wealth of silver which he seemed to feel somewhere about, to scent somewhere near. But where? Where? Heavens! Where? Oh! why had he allowed that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> to go? Imbecile that he was. But no! It was the only right course, he reflected, distractedly, while the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">messenger</rs> waited downstairs chatting agreeably to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">officers</rs>. It was in that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">scoundrelly doctor</rs>'s true interest to return with positive information. But what if anything stopped him? A general prohibition to leave the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>, for instance!</p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs>, seizing his head in his hands, turned upon himself as if struck with vertigo. A flash of craven inspiration suggested to him an expedient not unknown to European statesmen when they wish to delay a difficult negotiation. Booted and spurred, he scrambled into the hammock with undignified haste. He addressed the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">surprised envoy of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">astute Señor Fuentes</rs></rs> in a deadened, exhausted voice. It came pathetically feeble from under a vast pile of ponchos which buried <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">his elegant person</rs> right up to the black moustaches, uncurled, pendent in sign of bodily prostration and mental incapacity. Fever, fever. A heavy fever had overtaken the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">muy valliente Colonel</rs>. A wavering wildness of expression caused by the passing waves of a slight colic which had declared itself suddenly and the rattling teeth of repressed panic had a genuineness which impressed the envoy. It was a cold fit. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs> explained that he was unable to think, to listen, to speak. With an appearance of superhuman effort the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs> gasped out that he was not in a state to return a suitable reply or to execute any of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">his Excellency</rs>'s orders. But to-morrow! To-morrow! Ah! to-morrow! Let <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">his Excellency Don Pedro</rs> be without uneasiness. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">brave <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Esmeralda">Esmeralda</placeName> Regiment</rs> held the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>, held -- And closing his eyes he rolled his aching head like a half-delirious invalid under the inquisitive uncertain stare of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">envoy</rs>, who was obliged to bend down over the hammock in order to catch the painful and broken accents. Meantime he trusted that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">his Excellency</rs>'s humanity would permit the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">English doctor</rs>, to come out of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> with his case of foreign remedies to attend upon him. He begged anxiously <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">his worship the caballero</rs> now present for the grace of looking in as he passed the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldHouse">Casa Gould</placeName>, and informing the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">English doctor</rs>, who was probably there, that his services were immediately required by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel Sotillo</rs>, lying ill of fever in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Custom House</placeName>. Immediately. Most urgently required. Awaited with extreme impatience. A<cb n="99.327.2"/> thousand thanks. He closed his eyes wearily and would not open them again.</p> 
            <p>But as soon as the other had shut after him the door of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">landing</placeName>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs> leaped out with a fling of both feet in an avalanche of woollen coverings. His spurs having become entangled in a perfect welter of ponchos, he nearly pitched on his head, and did not recover his balance till the middle of the room. Concealed behind the half-closed jalousies he listened to what went on below.</p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">envoy</rs> had already mounted, and turning to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">morose officers</rs> occupying the great doorway, took off his hat formally. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">"Caballeros,"</said> he said, in a very loud tone, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">"allow me to recommend you to take great care of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">your Colonel</rs>. It has done me much honour and gratification to have seen you all, a fine body of men exercising the soldierly virtue of patience in this exposed situation, where there is much sun and no water to speak of, while a <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> full of wine and feminine charms is ready to embrace you for the brave men you are. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">Caballeros</rs>, I have the honour to salute you. There will be much dancing to-night in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>. Good-bye!"</said></p> 
            <p>But he reined in <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorsemanHorse">his horse</rs> and inclined his head sideways on seeing the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">old Major</rs> step out, very tall and meagre in a straight narrow coat coming down to his ankles as it were the casing of the regimental colours rolled round their staff.</p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">intelligent old warrior</rs>, after enunciating in a dogmatic tone the general proposition that the <said who="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">"world was full of traitors,"</said> went on pronouncing deliberately a panegyric upon <rs ref="serOgrahies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>. He ascribed to him with leisurely emphasis every virtue under heaven, summing it all up in an absurd colloquialism current amongst the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CostaguanaOccidentals">lower class of Occidentals</rs> (especially about <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Esmeralda">Esmeralda</placeName>). <said who="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">"And,"</said> he concluded, with a sudden rise in the voice, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">a man of many teeth</rs> -- <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">hombre de muchos dientes</rs>. Si, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">Señor</rs>. As to us,"</said> he pursued portentous and impressive; <said who="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">your worship</rs> is beholding the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">finest body of officers in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Republic</placeName></rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">men unequalled for valour and sagacity</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">y hombres de muchos dientes</rs>."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">"What? All?"</said>  inquired the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">disreputable envoy of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">Señor Fuentes</rs></rs>, with a faint, derisive smile.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">"Todos. Si, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">Señor</rs>,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">Major</rs> affirmed gravely, with conviction.</p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">other <!-- other to the old major --></rs> wheeled <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorsemanHorse">his horse</rs> to face the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">portal</placeName> resembling the high gate of a dismal barn. He raised himself in his long stirrups, extended one arm. He was a facetious scoundrel, entertaining a feeling of vast scorn for those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CostaguanaOccidentals">stupid Occidentals</rs> only natural in a native from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#centralProvinces">central provinces</placeName>. The folly of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Esmeraldians">Esmeraldians</rs> especially aroused his amused contempt. He began an oration upon <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedro Montero</rs>, keeping a solemn countenance. He flourished his hand as if introducing him to their notice. And when he saw every face set, all the eyes fixed upon his lips, he began to shout a sort of catalogue of perfections: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">"Generous valorous, affable, profound</said> -- (he snatched off his hat enthusiastically)-- <said> a statesman, an invincible chief of partisans --"</said> He dropped his voice startlingly to a deep hollow note -- <said who="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">"y dentista!"</said></p> 
            <p>He was off instantly at a smart walk; the rigid straddle of his legs, the turned out feet, the stiff back, the rakish slant<cb n="99.327.3"/> of the sombrero above the square, motionless set of the shoulders, expressing an awe-inspiring impudence.</p> 
            <p><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Upstairs</placeName>, behind the jalousies, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> did not move for a long time. The audacity of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesHorseman">fellow</rs> appalled him. What were <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">his officers</rs> saying below? They were saying nothing. Complete silence. He quaked. It was not thus that he had imagined himself at that stage of the expedition. He had seen himself triumphant, unquestioned, appeased, the idol of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">soldiers</rs>, weighing in secret complacency the agreeable alternatives of power and wealth open to his choice. Alas! How different! Distracted, restless, supine, burning with fury, or frozen with terror, he felt a dread as fathomless as the sea creep upon him from every side. That <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">rogue of a doctor</rs> had to come out with his information. That was clear. It would be of no use to him -- alone. He could have done nothing with it. Malediction! The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> would never come out. He was probably under arrest already, shut up together with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs> -- he laughed aloud insanely. Ha! ha! ha! ha! It was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs> who would get the information. Ha! -- and the silver. Ha!</p> 
            <p>All at once, in the midst of the laugh, he became motionless and silent as it turned into stone. He, too, had <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">a prisoner</rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">A prisoner</rs> who must, must know the real truth. He would have to be made to speak. And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, who all that time had not quite forgotten <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Hirsch</rs>, felt an inexplicable reluctance at the notion of proceeding to extremities.</p> 
            <p>He felt a reluctance -- part of that unfathomable dread that crept on all sides upon him. He remembered reluctantly, too, the dilated eyes of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">hide merchant</rs>, his contortions, his loud sobs and protestations. It was not compassion or even mere nervous sensibility. The fact was that though he did never for a moment believe his story -- he could not believe it; nobody could believe such nonsense -- yet those accents of despairing truth impressed him disagreeably. They made him feel sick. And he suspected also that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">man</rs> might have gone mad with fear. A lunatic is a hopeless subject. Bah! A pretence. Nothing but a pretence. He would know how to deal with that.</p> 
            <p>He was working himself up to the right pitch of ferocity. His fine eyes squinted slightly; he clapped his hands; <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">a barefooted orderly</rs> appeared noiselessly, a corporal with his bayonet hanging on his thigh and a stick in his hand.</p>

        <div type="chapter" n="3.9.357">
            <head>CHAPTER IX. (continued).</head>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs> gave his order, and presently the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">miserable wretch</rs>, pushed in by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">several soldiers</rs>, found him frowning awfully in a broad armchair, hat on head, knees wide apart, arms akimbo, masterful, imposing, irresistible, haughty, sublime, terrible.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Hirsch</rs>, with his arms tied behind his back, had been bundled violently into <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">one of the smaller rooms</placeName>. For many hours he remained apparently forgotten, stretched lifelessly on the floor. From that solitude, full of despair and terror, he was torn out brutally, with kicks and blows, passive, sunk in hebetude. He listened to threats and admonitions, and afterwards made his usual answers to questions, with his chin sunk on his breast, his hands tied behind his back, swaying a little in front of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, and never looking up. When he was forced to hold up his head, by means of a bayonet-point prodding him under the chin, his eyes had a vacant trancelike stare, and drops of perspiration as big as peas were seen hailing down the dirt, bruises, and scratches of his white face. Then they stopped suddenly.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> looked at him in silence. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Will you depart from your obstinacy, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">you rogue</rs>?"</said> he asked. Already a rope whose one end was fastened to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Señor Hirsch</rs>'s wrists had been thrown over a beam, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">three soldiers</rs> held the other end, waiting. He made no answer. His lower lip hung down stupidly. At a sign from <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> he was jerked up off his feet, and a loud yell of terror and agony burst out in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName>, filled the passages of the great <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">building</placeName>, rent the air outside, caused every <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">soldier in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMenCamp">bivouac</placeName></rs> along the shore to look up at the windows, started some of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">officers</rs> in the hall babbling excitedly, with shinning eyes. Others, setting their lips hard, looked at the floor.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgrapahies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, followed by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">soldiers</rs>, had left the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName>, The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">sentry on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">landing</placeName></rs> presented arms, and a wide, open mouth, incredibly wide, black, enormous, full of teeth -- comical.</p>
            <p>In the still, burning air of the windless afternoon he made the waves of his agony travel as far as the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN">O.S.N. Co.'s offices</placeName>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN">balcony</placeName>, trying to make out what went on generally, heard him faintly, but distinctly. The feeble and appalling sound lingered in his ears after he had retreated indoors with blanched cheeks. He was driven off the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN">balcony</placeName> several times during the afternoon.</p><cb n="916.357.2"/>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, irritable, moody, walked restlessly about, held consultations with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">his officers</rs>, gave contradictory orders in this shrill clamour pervading the whole empty edifice, and ceasing suddenly for a long and awful period of silence. Several times he had entered the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">torture chamber</placeName>, where his sword, horsewhip, revolver, and field-glass were lying on the table, to ask with forced calmness, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Will you speak the truth now. No? I can wait."</said> But he could not afford to wait much longer.</p> 
            <p>The sun had set when he went in once more. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">A soldier</rs> carried in two lighted candles behind him, and, after putting them on the table, slunk out, shutting the door without noise.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Speak, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">thou Jewish child of the devil</rs>. The silver! The silver I say! Where is it? Where have <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch serOgraphies.xml#Blancos">you foreign rogues</rs> hidden it? Confess or --"</said></p>
            <p>A slight quiver passed up the taut rope from the racked limbs, but the body of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Señor Hirsch</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">enterprising business man from <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Esmeralda">Esmeralda</placeName></rs>, hung under the heavy beam, perpendicular and silent, facing the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs> awfully. The inflow of the night air, cooled by the snows of the <placeName ref="SerOgraphies.xml#Sierra">Sierra</placeName>, spread gradually a delicious freshness through the close heat of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Speak-- <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">thief</rs> -- <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">scoundrel</rs> -- <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">picaro</rs> -- or --"</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> had seized the horsewhip off the table, and stood with his arm lifted high. For a word -- for one little word -- he felt he could have knelt, cringed, grovelled on the floor before the drowsy conscious stare of those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">fixed eyeballs</rs> starting out of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">grimy, dishevelled head</rs> that drooped very still, with its mouth closed askew. He cried out again, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Speak;"</said> then ground his teeth -- and struck. The rope vibrated leisurely to the blow, like the long string of a pendulum starting from a rest. But no swinging motion was imparted to the body of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Señor Hirsch</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">well-known hide merchant on the coast</rs>. With a convulsive effort of the twisted arms it leaped up a few inches, curling upon itself like a fish on the end of a line. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Señor Hirsch</rs>'s head was flung back on his straining throat, his chin trembled. For a moment the rattle of his chattering teeth pervaded the vast shadowy <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName> where the candles made a patch of light round the two flames burning straight side by side. And as <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> stayed his raised hand in the hope of hearing him speak, with a sudden grinning curl of the lips and a straining forward of the wrenched shoulders, he spat violently into his face.</p>
            <p>The whip fell from the uplifted hand and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Colonel</rs> sprang back with a low, choking cry, as if aspersed by a jet of corrosive poison. Quick as thought he snatched up his revolver and fired twice.<cb n="916.357.3"/> The report and the concussion of the shots seemed to throw him at once from a state of ungovernable rage into an idiotic stupor. He stood with drooping jaw and stony eyes. What had he done! Sangre de Dios! What had he done! He was basely appalled at his impulsive act, sealing for ever those <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">lips from which so much was to be extorted</rs>. What could he say to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">his officers</rs>? How could he explain? Ideas of headlong flight -- somewhere, anywhere -- passed through his mind; even the craven and absurd notion of hiding under the table occurred to his cowardice. It was too late; <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">his staff</rs> had rushed in tumultuously in a great clatter of scabbards, clamouring noisily with astonishment and wonder. But since they did not immediately proceed to plunge their swords into his breast the brazen side of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs><!--a-->'s character asserted itself. Passing the sleeve of his uniform over his unpleasantly wet eyelids, he pulled himself together. His overbearing glance, directed here and there, checked the noise where it fell and the stiff body of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">late Señor Hirsch</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">merchant</rs>, swaying imperceptibly on the taut rope, after the supreme effort of his life, made a distinct half-turn, and came to a rest facing the awed murmurs and the uneasy shuffling of boot soles.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMenVoice">A voice</rs> cried out profoundly, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMenVoice">"Here is a man who will never speak again."</said> And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMenAnotherVoice">another</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMenAnotherVoice">a young one</rs>, from the back row of faces, timid and pressing, inquired shrilly:</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMenAnotherVoice">"Why did you kill the <rs ref="SerOgrahies.xml#Hirsch">Jew</rs>, <rs ref="serOgrapahies.xml#Sotillo">mi Colonel</rs>?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">"Because he has confessed everything,"</said> answered <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, with the hardihood of desperation. He felt himself cornered. He brazened it out on the strength of his reputation with very fair success. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">His hearers</rs> thought him very capable of such an act. They were disposed to believe his flattering tale. Ah! He had confessed everything this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">factious Jew</rs>, this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">bribon</rs>. Good! Then he was no longer wanted. A sudden dense guffaw was heard from the <rs ref="serOgraphiesx.xml#SotilloMen">senior captain</rs>, a big-headed man, with little round eyes, and monstrously fat cheeks, which never moved. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">old major</rs>, tall, lean, and fantastically ragged like a scarecrow, walked round the body of the late <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Señor Hirsch</rs> twice, muttering to himself with ineffable complacency that like this there was no need to guard against any future treacheries of that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">rastrero</rs>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">others <!-- other than the old major --></rs> stared, shifting from foot to foot, and whispering short remarks to each other.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, half-averted from their eyes he feared to face, buckled on his sword, and gave curt, peremptory orders to hasten the retirement decided upon in the afternoon. Sinister, impressive, his wide sombrero pulled right down upon his<cb n="916.358.1"/><pb n="358"/> eye-brows, he marched first through the door, in such disorder of mind that he even forgot to provide for <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor Monygham</rs>'s possible return. As they trooped out after him, whispering, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">one or two</rs> looked back curiously at the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">late Señor Hirsch</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">merchant of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Esmeralda">Esmeralda</placeName></rs>, left swinging rigidly at rest, alone with the two burning candles.</p>
            <p>Below, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">troops</rs> fell in silently and moved off by companies without drum or trumpet. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">old scarecrow major</rs> commanded the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">rearguard</rs>; but the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">party he left behind <!-- "he" refers to the old Major --> with orders to fire the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Custom House</placeName></rs> (and <said who="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">"burn the carcass of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">treacherous Jew</rs> where it hung")</said> failed somehow, in their haste, to set the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">staircase</placeName> properly alight. The body of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">late Señor Hirsch</rs> dwelt alone for a time in the dismal solitude of the vast unfinished <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">building</placeName>. He remained to startle <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> with his shadow, and to puzzle <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> by the mystery of his atrocious end.</p></div>
        <div><head>Chapter X.</head>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"But why shot?"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> again asked himself, audibly. This time he was answered by a dry laugh from <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"You seem much concerned at a very simple thing, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Señor Doctor</rs>. I wonder at you. It is very likely that before long we shall all get shot one after another, if not by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> then by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs>, or <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Fuentes</rs>, or <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs>. And we may even get the estrapade, too, or worse, quien sabe? with your pretty tale of the silver you put into <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>'s head --"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"It was in his head already,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> protested. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I only --"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Yes. You only nailed it there so that the devil himself --" </said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"That is precisely what I meant to do,"</said> caught up the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"That is what you meant to do. Bueno. It is as I say. You are a dangerous man."</said></p>
            <p>Their voices, which, without rising, had been growing quarrelsome, ceased suddenly. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">late Señor Hirsch</rs>, erect and shadowy against the stars, seemed to be listening attentive, in silence.</p>
            <p>But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> had no mind to quarrel with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>. At this supremely critical point of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>'s fortunes it was borne upon him at last that this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">man</rs> was really indispensable, more indispensable than ever the infatuation of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">his proud discoverer</rs>, could conceive. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">fellow</rs> was unique. He was not <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">one in a thousand</rs>."</said> He was absolutely the <rs ref="serOgraphies.mxl#Nostromo">only one</rs>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> surrendered.</p>
            <p>In a completely unchanged tone he pointed out to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> that to begin with, he, personally, ran the least risk of all. As far as everybody knew he was dead. It was an enormous advantage. He had only to keep out of sight in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">Casa Viola</placeName>, where the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Garibaldino</rs> was known to be alone with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">his dead wife</rs>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"That would be very true,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> spoke up bitterly, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"if I had not met you."</said></p>
            <p>For a time the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> kept silent.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Do you mean to say that you think I may give you away,"</said> he asked in an unsteady voice. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mongyam">"Why? Why should I do that?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"What do I know? Why not? To gain a day perhaps. It would take <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> a day to give me the estrapade<cb n="916.358.2"/> and try some other things perhaps, before he puts a bullet through my heart, as he did to that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">poor wretch</rs> here. Why not?"</said></p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> had swallowed with difficulty. His throat had gone dry in a moment. It was not from indignation. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> pathetically enough believed that he had forfeited all moral right to be indignant with anyone -- for anything. It was dead simple dread. Had the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">fellow</rs> heard his story by some chance? A feeling of as if of sickness came upon him. He would have given anything to know, but he dared not clear up the point by a direct question or even an allusion. The fanaticism of his devotion fed on the sense of his abasement hardened his heart with sadness and scorn.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Why not indeed?"</said> he re-echoed sardonically. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Then the safe thing for you is to kill me on the spot. It would defend myself. But you may just was well know that I am going about unarmed."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Por Dios,"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> passionately. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#hombreFinos">You fine people</rs> are all alike. All dangerous. All betrayers of the poor, who are your dogs."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"You do not understand,"</said> began the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> slowly.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I understand you all!"</said> cried the other with a violent movement, as shadowy to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>'s eyes as the persistent immobility of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">late Señor Hirsch</rs>. <said>"A poor man amongst you has to look after himself. I say that you do not care for those that serve you. Look at me! After all these years --"</said> Suddenly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Here I find myself like one of these <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#dogs">curs</rs> that bark outside the walls -- without a kennel or a dry bone for my teeth. Caramba!"</said></p>
            <p>But he added, with a contemptuous fairness, in a quieter tone:</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Of course, I do not suppose that you would hasten to give me up to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, for example. It is not likely. It is that I am nothing!"</said> Suddenly.</p>
            <p>He swung his arms downwards.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Nothing to anyone,"</said> he repeated.</p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> breathed freely.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Listen, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>,"</said> he said, stretching out his hand almost affectionately towards <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s shoulder. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I am going to tell you a very simple thing. You are safe because you are needed."</said></p>
            <p>In the dark <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> bit his lip. He had heard enough of that. He knew what that meant. No more of it for him. But he had to look after himself now, he thought. And he thought, too, that it would not be prudent to part in anger from <rs ref="serOGraphies.xml#Monygham">his companion <!-- "his" refers to Nostromo --></rs>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, admitted to be a great healer, had amongst the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">populace of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName></rs> the reputation of being an evil-minded man. This reputation was based solidly on personal appearance, which was strange, and on the rough, sardonic manner. And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> was of the people. He only grunted.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"You, to speak plainly, are the only man,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> pursued. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"It is in your power to save this <placeName ref="serOgrahies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> and -- everybody, from the destructive rapacity of men who --"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"No, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">señor</rs>,"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, sullenly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"It is not in my power. I cannot get the treasure back for you to give up to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, or <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs>, or <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs>. What do I know?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Nobody expects the impossible."</said> was the answer.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"You have said it yourself,"</said> muttered <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> in a gloomy, threatening tone. <said>"It is impossible."</said></p><cb n= "916.358.3"/>
            <p>But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, full of hope, disregarded the enigmatic words and the threatening tone. To their eyes, accustomed to obscurity, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">late Señor Hirsch</rs>, growing more distinct, seemed to have come nearer. And the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> lowered his voice in exposing his scheme, as though afraid of being overheard.</p>
            <p>He was taking the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">indispensable man</rs> into his fullest confidence. Its implied flattery and suggestion of great risks came with a familiar sound to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>. His mind, floating in irresolution and discontent, recognised it with bitterness. He understood well that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> was anxious to save the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName> from annihilation. He would be nothing without it. It was his interest. Just as it had been the interest of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Señor Decoud</rs>, of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Blancos">Blancos</rs>, and of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#CostaguanaEuropeans">Europeans</rs>, to get <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">his Cargadores</rs> on their side. His thought became arrested upon <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs>. What would happen to him?</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s prolonged silence made the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> uneasy. He pointed out to him, quite unnecessarily, that, though for the present he was safe, he could not live concealed for ever. The choice was between accepting the mission to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs>, with all its dangers and difficulties, and leaving <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> by stealth, ingloriously, in poverty.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"None of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#NostromoFriends">your friends</rs> could reward you and protect you just now, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>.

            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I would have none of your protection and none of your rewards. I only wish I could trust your courage and your sense.

            <p>It was the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>'s turn to remain silent in the contemplation of possible contingencies that filled him with horror, with dread, with misery.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Well, we are ready to trust your courage and your sense. And you as well have a knife at your throat -- remember."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Ah! And whom am I to thank for that?

            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I don't know,"</said> burst out the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">exasperated doctor</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"There are innocent people in danger whose little finger is worth more than you or I and all the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ribierist">Ribierists</rs> together. I don't know. You should have asked yourself before you allowed <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs> to lead you into all this. It was your place to think like a man; but if you did not think before-hand, then try to act like a man now. Did you imagine <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs> cared very much what would happen to you?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"No more than you care what will happen to me,"</said> muttered the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">other </rs>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Exactly. I care for what will happen to you as little as I care for what will happen to myself."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"And all this because you are such a devoted <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ribierist">Ribierist</rs>,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> said in an incredulous tone.</p>

            <p>Again <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, gazing absently at the body of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">late Señor Hirsch</rs>, remained silent, thinking that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> was a dangerous person in more than one way. It was impossible to trust him.</p><cb n="916.359.1"/><pb n="359"/>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Do you speak in the name of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs>?"</said> he asked at last.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Yes, I do."</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> said loudly, without hesitation. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Gould</rs> must come out of his reserve now. He must,"</said> he added to himself, in a mutter, which <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> did not catch.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"What did you say, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Señor</rs>?"</said></p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> started.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I say that you must be true to yourself, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>. It would be worse than folly to fail now."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"True to myself,"</said> repeated <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"How do you know that I would not be true to myself if I told you to go to the devil with your propositions?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I do not know. Maybe you would."</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> said, with a roughness of tone intended to hide the sinking of his heart and the faltering of his voice. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"All I know is that you had better get away from this place. Some of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>'s men</rs> may turn up here looking for me."</said></p>
            <p>He slipped off the table, listed intently. The <rs ref="serOgrapahies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>, too, stood up.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Suppose I went, what would you do meantime?"</said> he asked.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I would go to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> directly you had left -- in the way I proposed."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"A very good way, if only that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer-in-Chief</rs> consents. Remind him, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Señor</rs>, that I looked after the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SirJohn">old rich Englishman who pays for the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway</placeName></rs>, and that I saved the lives of some of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayWorkers">his people <!-- "his" refers to the EIC --></rs> that time when a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railwayThieves">gang of thieves</rs> came from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#CostaguanaSouth">south</placeName> on purpose to wreck one of his pay-trains. It was I who discovered it all at the risk of my life by pretending to enter into their plans. Just as you are doing with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> yourself." </said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Yes. Yes of course. But I can offer him better arguments,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> said hastily. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Leave it to me."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Ah, yes! True! I am nothing"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Not at all. You are everything."</said></p>
            <p>They moved a few paces towards the door. Behind them the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">late Señor Hirsch</rs> preserved his immobility of a disregarded man.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"That will be all right. I know what to say to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer</rs>,"</said> pursued the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> in a low tone. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"My difficulty will be with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>."</said></p>
            <p>And <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</said> stopped short in the doorway as if intimidated by the difficulty. He had made the sacrifice of his life on this eminently fit and proper opportunity. But he did not want to throw his life away too soon. To keep up his character of betrayer of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs>'s confidence he would have ultimately to indicate the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#TreasureHidingPlaceFalse">hiding-place of the treasure</placeName>. That would be the end of his deception, and the end of himself as well at the hands of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">infuriated Colonel</rs>. He wanted to delay any action against the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> or an alliance with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs> to the very last moment; and he had been racking his brains to invent some place of concealment at once plausible and difficult of access.</p>
            <p>He imparted his trouble to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> in a few words, and concluded:</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Do you know what, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>? I think that when the time comes, and some sort of information as to the silver has to be given, I shall indicate the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#TreasureHidingPlaceFalseAndTureGreatIsabel">Great Isabel</placeName>. That is the best place I can think of -- What's the matter?"</said></p>
            <p>A low exclamation had escaped <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>. The doctor waited surprised, and, after a moment of silence, heard a thick voice stammer out the words <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Utter folly!"</said> and stop with a gasp.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I do not see that."</said></p><cb n="916.359.2"/>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Ah! You do not see,"</said> began <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> scathingly, gathering scorn as he went on. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"You do not see that three men in half an hour's search would find out that no ground had been disturbed anywhere on that <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#TreasureHidingPlaceFalseAndTrueGreatIsabel">island</placeName>, that had never known pick or spade! Do you think that such a treasure can be buried without leaving traces of the work -- eh, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Señor Doctor</rs>? Why, you would not gain an extra half-day by it before having your throat cut by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#TreasureHidingPlaceFalseAndTrueGreatIsabel">Isabel</rs>! What stupidity. Ah! you are all alike, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#hombreFinos">you fine men <!-- "you" refers to Monygham --></rs> of intelligence. All you are fit for is to betray men of the people into undertaking deadly risks for objects that you are not even sure that you want. If the adventure comes off you may get the benefit. If not, then it does not matter. There is only a dog the less. Ah, Madre de Dios! I would --"</said> He shook his fists above his head, as if choking with rage.</p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> was overwhelmed at first by this fierce hissing vehemence.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Well! It appears, on your own showing, that the men of the people are no mean fools, too,"</said> he said sullenly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"No, but come. You who are so clever. Have you a better plan?"</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> had calmed down as quickly as he had flared up.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I am clever enough for that,"</said> he said quietly, almost with indifference. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"You want, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Señor Doctor</rs>, to tell <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> of a hiding place vast enough to take days in ransacking -- a place where a treasure of silver ingots can be buried without leaving a sign on the surface."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"And close at hand,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> put in. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"He has made up his mind to cling to this <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Just so, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">señor</rs>. Tell him it is sunk."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"This has the merit of being the truth,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> said contemptuously. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Don't you understand that he will not believe it? Moreover that is not my object."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"You tell <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> that it is sunk where he may hope to lay his hands on it, and he will believe you quick enough. He will drink it up like poison from your hand. Tell him it has been sunk in this shallow <placeName ref="serpOgraphies.xml#TreasureHidingPlaceFalse2">harbour</placeName> in order to be recovered easily afterwards by divers. Tell him you found out that I had private orders from <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs> to lower the cases quietly overboard somewhere in a line <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#TreasureHidingPlaceFalse2">between the end of the jetty and the entrance</placeName> before I went out in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighter">lighter</placeName> with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Señor Decoud</rs>. The depth is not too great there. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs><!--a--> has no divers, but he has a <placeName ref="serOgrphies.xml#SotilloShip">ship</placeName>, boats, ropes, chains, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">sailors</rs> -- of a sort. Let him start fishing for the silver. Let him set <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SotilloMen">his fools</rs> to drag for it, backwards and forwards and cross ways, while he sits and watches till his eyes drop out."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Really, this is an admirable idea,"</said> muttered the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Si. You tell him that, and see whether he will not believe you! He will spend his days in rage and torment -- and still he will believe. He will have no thought for anything else. He will not give up till he is driven off. Why, he may even forget to kill you! He shall neither eat or sleep; he --"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"The very thing! The very thing!"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> repeated in an excited whisper. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>, I begin to believe that you are a great genius.</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> had paused, then spoke again in a changed tone, sombre, to himself, as though he had forgotten the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">other <!-- other to Nostromo --></rs>'s existence.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"There is something in a treasure that fastens upon a man's mind. He will pray and blaspheme, and still persevere, and will curse the day he ever heard of it, and will let his last hour creep upon him unawares, still believing that he missed it only by a foot. He will see it resting in shallow water every time he closes his eyes. He will never forget it till he is dead, and even then --. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, did you ever hear what the people here say of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#gringos">miserable gringos on <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Azuera">Azuera</placeName></rs> that cannot get away from their treasure, and pray in vain for death? Ha! ha! A good tale. Sailors like myself. There is no getting away from a treasure that once fastens upon your mind."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"You are a man of infinite resource, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>. It is the most plausible thing. You seem to understand <rs ref="serOgrapahies.xml#Sotillo">our Sotillo <!-- "our" refers to Nostromo and Monygham --></rs> as though you had been in his skin.</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> pressed hard the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>'s arm.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"It will be worse for him that thirst at sea, or hunger in a town full of people. Do you know what that is? He shall suffer greater torments than he inflicted upon that terrified wretch who had no invention. None! none! Not like me. I could have to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> a deadly tale for very little pain."</said></p>
            <p>He laughed wildly, and turned in the doorway towards the body of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">late Señor Hirsch</rs>, an opaque long blotch in the semi-transparent obscurity of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">room</placeName> between the two tall parallelograms of the windows of the stars.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">You man of fear</rs>. You shall be avenged by me, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>! Out of my way <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>! Stand aside! Or by the unabsolved soul of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTheresa">a woman dead without confession</rs> I will strangle you with my two hands!"</said></p>
            <p>He bounded downwards into the black, smoky hall. With a grunt of astonishment <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> pursued. At the bottom of the charred stairs he had a fall, pitching forward on his face with a force that would have quenched a spirit less intent upon a task of love and devotion. He was up in a moment, jarred, shaken, with a strange impression of the terrestrial globe having been flung at his head in the dark. But it wanted something more than that to stop <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>'s body, possessed by the exaltation of self-sacrifice; a reasonable exaltation, determined not to lose whatever advantage change put into its way. He ran with a headlong, tottering swiftness, his long arms going like a windmill in his effort to keep his balance on his crippled feet. He lost his hat; the tails of his open gaberdine flew behind him. He had no mind to lose sight of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">indispensable man</rs>. But it was a long time, and a long way from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Custom House</placeName>, before he managed to seize his arm from behind, roughly, out of breath.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Stop! Are you mad?"</said></p>
            <p>Already <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> was walking slow, his head dropping, as if checked in his pace by the weariness of irresolution.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"What is that to you? Ah! I forgot you want me for something. Always. Siempre <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"What do you mean by talking of strangling me?"</said> panted the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"What do I mean? I mean that the king of the devils himself has sent you out of this <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town of cowards and talkers</placeName>to meet me to-night of all the nights of my life."</said></p>

            <p>Under the blue sombreness of the starry sky the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">Albergo d'Italia Una</placeName> emerged, black and low, breaking the dark level of the plain, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> stopped altogether.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"The priests say he is a tempter, do they not?"</said> he added, through his clenched teeth.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">My good man</rs>, you rave. The devil has nothing to do with this. Neither has the town, which you may call by what name you please. But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos Gould</rs> is neither a coward nor an empty talker. You will admit that?"</said> He waited. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Well?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Could I see <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs>?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Great heavens! No! Why?

I will not let you go into the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> for anything."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I must."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"You will not!"</said> hissed the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> fiercely, almost beside himself with the fear of the man doing away with his usefulness for an imbecile whim of some sort. <said>"I tell you you shall not. I would rather --"</said></p>
            <p>He stopped at loss for words, feeling fagged out, powerless, holding on to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s sleeve absolutely for support after his run.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I am betrayed,"</said> muttered the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> to himself, and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> who overheard the last word, made an effort to speak calmly.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"That is exactly what would happen to you."</said></p>
            <p>He thought with a sickening dread that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">man</rs> was so well known that he could not escape recognition. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">house</placeName> of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Señor Administrador</rs> was beset by spies, no doubt.

            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I am laughing to think that if somebody that did not like me being in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>, for instance -- you understand, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Señor Doctor</rs> -- if somebody were to give me up to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs>, it would not be beyond me to make friends even with him.

            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I understand that on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName> you were pretty free in laying about you with a thick stick amongst <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">your poor Cargadores</rs>,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> said in a grim tone, which showed that he was recovering<cb n="923.389.2"/> from his exertions. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Make no mistake. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs> is furious at <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ribiera">Señor Ribiera</rs>'s rescue, and at having lost the pleasure of shooting <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs>. Already there is a rumour in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> of the treasure having been taken away; but let me tell you that if you had it in your hand to give to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs> it would not save you. No. It would not save you."</said></p>
            <p>Turning swiftly, and catching the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> by the shoulders, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> thrust his face close to his.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Maladetta! You follow me speaking of the treasure. You have sworn my ruin. You were the last man who looked upon me before I went out with it. And the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sidoni">Roman engine-driver</rs> says you have an evil eye."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"He ought to know. I saved his broken leg for him,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> said stoically. Held as in a vice, he felt on his shoulders the crushing grip of those hands famed amongst the populace for snapping thick ropes and bending horseshoes.<said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"And to you I offer the best means of saving yourself -- let me go -- and of retrieving your great reputation. You boasted of making the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz of Cargadores</rs> talked about from one end of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#America">America</placeName> to the other about this wretched silver. But I bring you a better opportunity -- let me go, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">hombre</rs>!"</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> released him at last. He did not run off as the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> had feared. Those <!-- unsure how to tag the following rs: --><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#UNKNOWN">two men</rs> seemed unable to part. They walked together till, within a stone's throw from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">Casa Viola</placeName>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> stopped again.</p>
            <p>Silent in its inhospitable darkness, the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">Casa Viola</placeName> seemed to him to have changed its nature; to have become hopeless and inimical in a mysterious way. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> said:</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"You will be safe there. Go in, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"How can I go in?"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> seemed to ask himself in a low, inward tone.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I tell you it is all right. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Viola</rs> is alone. I looked in as I came out of the town. You will be perfectly safe in that <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">house</placeName> till you leave it to make your name famous on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Campo">Campo</placeName>. I am going now to arrange your departure, and shall be with you again long before daybreak."</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, disregarding, or perhaps fearing to penetrate the meaning of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s silence, clapped him lightly on the shoulder and started off with his smart lame walk. His tall form vanished utterly after the third or fourth hop in the direction of the railway track.</p>

            <head>Chapter XI.</head>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> did not budge, as though he had been planted as solidly in the ground as the two heavy wooden posts for people to fasten their horses to, near which he stood. At the end of half an hour he lifted his head to the<cb n="923.389.3"/>deep baying of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#animals">dogs</rs> at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway yards</placeName>, which had burst out suddenly tumultous, and deadened as if coming from under the plain. That <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">lame doctor with the evil eye</rs> had got there pretty fast.</p>
            <p>Step by step <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> approached the middle door of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">Albergo d'Italia Una</placeName>, which he had never known so lightless, so silent, before. It stood, all black in the pale wall, wide open as he had left it twenty-four hours before, when he had nothing to hide from the world. He stood before it, irresolute, like fugitive, like a man betrayed. Poverty, misery, starvation! Where had he heard these words? The anger of a <!-- is the following an alias or, because it is preceded by "a" rather than "the" denoting no real specificity, something other than a name or alias? For now it remains untagged because of the generality implied by the article "a" despite the obvious fact that it refers specifically to Teresa. -->dying woman had prophesied that fate for his folly. It looked as if it would come true very quickly. And the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#leperos">leperos</rs> would laugh -- she had said. Yes, they would laugh if they knew that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz de Cargadores</rs> was at the mercy of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">mad doctor</rs> whom they could remember, only a few years ago, buying cooked food from a stall on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Plaza">Plaza</placeName> for a copper coin -- like themselves.</p> 
            <p>At that moment the notion of seeking <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> passed through his mind. He glanced in the direction of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#jetty">jetty</placeName> and saw a small gleam of light in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN">O.S.N. Company's building</placeName>. The thought of lighted windows was not attractive. Once before he had been decoyed by lighted windows. No; he would not go near. He could not confide in <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>. That <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> would worm it all out of him as if he were a child.</p>
            <p>On the threshold he said <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Giorgio</rs>!"</said> in an undertone. Nobody answered. He stepped in. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Olà! <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">viejo</rs>!"</said> he cried low. In the impenetrable darkness his head swam with the illusion that the obscurity of the kitchen was as vast as the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gulf">Placid Gulf</placeName>, and that the floor dipped forward like the sinking lighter. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Ola! <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">viejo</rs>!"</said> he repeated, falteringly, swaying where he stood. His hand, extended to steady himself, fell upon the table. Moving a step forward, he shifted it, and felt a box of matches under his fingers. He fancied he had heard a quiet sigh. He listened for a moment, holding his breath; then, with trembling hands, tried to strike a light.</p> 
            <p>The tiny piece of wood flamed up quite suddenly, blindingly, at the end of his fingers, raised above his blinking eyes. A sort of concentrated glare fell upon the leonine white head of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Giorgio</rs> against the black fireplace -- showed him leaning forward in a chair in staring immobility, surrounded, overhung by great masses of shadow, his legs crossed, his cheek in his hand, an empty pipe in the corner of his mouth. It seemed hours before he attempted to turn his face; and at the very moment he disappeared, overwhelmed by the<cb n="923.390.1"/><pb n="390"/> shadows as if the walls and roof of the desolate <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">house</placeName> had collapsed upon his white head in ghostly silence.</p>
            <p>The match had gone out, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> heard him stir and utter dispassionately the words:</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">"It may have been a vision."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"No,"</said> he said, softly.</p>
            <p>A strong chest voice asked very loud in the dark:</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">"Is that you I hear, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Giovann' Battista</rs>?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Si <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">viejo</rs>. Steady. Not so loud."</said></p>
            <p>Helped after their release to his very threshold by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer-in-Chief</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old man</rs>, with a muttered word of thanks, had re-entered his <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">house</placeName>, which he had been made to leave almost at the very moment of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTeresa">his wife</rs>'s death. All was still. The lamp above was burning. He nearly called out to her by name; and the thought that no call from him would ever again evoke her voice made him drop heavily into the chair with a loud groan, wrung out by the pain, as of a keen blade piercing his breast.</p>
            <p>Afterwards he made no sound. The black night turned to grey, and on the colourless, clear, glassy dawn the jagged <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sierra">sierra</placeName> stood out flat and opaque, as if cut out of paper.</p>
            <p>The enthusiastic and severe soul of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Giorgio Viola</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">sailor</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">champion of oppressed humanity</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">enemy of kings</rs>, and, by the grace of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">hotel-keeper of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName></rs>, had descended into the open abyss of desolation amongst the shattered vestiges of his past. He remembered his wooing between two campaigns, a single short week in the season of gathering olives. Nothing approached the grave passion of that time but the deep, passionate sense of his bereavement, discovering all the extent of his dependence upon the silenced voice of that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTeresa">woman</rs>. It was her voice that he would miss, because, abstracted and busy, or lost in inward contemplation, he had, as a matter of fact, seldom looked at his <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTeresa">wife</rs>. Of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">his girls</rs> he did not think. They were a matter of concern, not of consolation; he could not imagine himself dependent upon <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">his daughters</rs> for anything. But he remembered the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaSon">other child</rs> -- the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaSon">little boy who died at sea</rs>. Ah! a man would have been something to lean upon. And, alas! even <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Gian' Battista</rs> -- he of whom, and of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">Linda</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTeresa">his wife</rs> had spoken to him before she dropped off into her last sleep on earth, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">he on whom she had called before she died</rs> -- and even he was dead.</p>
            <p>And the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old man</rs>, bent forward, his head in his hand, sat in solitude and immobility through the day with stony face. He never heard the brazen roar of the bells in town. When it ceased the filter in the corner went on swiftly drip, drip into the vast porous jar below.</p> 
            <p>Whenever he attempted to move about he had to catch at the backs of chairs, the edges of the tables, or steady himself against the walls, as if rendered dizzy by his grief. Several times he got up thus with the vague notion of doing something or going somewhere -- and gave it up. Once he seized his pipe off the table, but made no attempt to reach the tobacco, thrust it empty into the corner of his mouth; and sat down again in the same staring pose. The sun of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs>'s entry into <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>, the last of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hirsch">Señor Hirsch</rs>'s life, the first of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs>'s solitude on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">Great Isabel</placeName> passed<cb n="923.390.2"/> over the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">Albergo d'Italia Una</placeName> on its way to the west. The tinkling drip, drip of the filter had ceased, the lamp upstairs had burnt itself out, and the night beset him and his dead with its obscurity and silence that seemed invincible till the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz de Cargadores</rs> put them to flight with a flaring match.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Si <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">viejo</rs>. It is me. Wait."</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, after barricading the door and closing the shutters carefully, groped upon a shelf for a candle, and lit it.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Old Viola</rs> had risen, and followed with his eyes in the dark the sounds made by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>. The light disclosed him standing without support, as if the mere presence of that <!-- uncertain how to tag the following and subsequent uses of 'who' modifiers of an rs for a character --><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">man who was what he would have liked his son to have been</rs> had been a source of consolation and strength.</p>
            <p>He extended his hand, grasping the old briar-wood pipe, whose bowl was charred black on the edge, and knitted his bushy eyebrows heavily at the light.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">"You have returned,"</said> he said with shaky dignity. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">"Ah! Very well! I --"</said></p>
            <p>He broke off. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, leaning back against the edge of the table with folded arms, nodded at him slightly.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"You thought I was drowned! No! The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">best dog of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#hombresFinos">rich</rs></rs>, of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#hombresFinos">aristocrats</rs>, of these <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#hombresFinos">fine men</rs> who can only talk and betray the people, is not dead yet."</said></p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Garibaldino</rs>, motionless, seemed to drink in the familiar sounds. His head moved slightly once as if in sign of approval; but <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> saw clearly that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old man</rs> understood not the words he heard. There was no one to understand either his feelings or his perplexity.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Old Giorgio</rs>'s heavy frame shook from head to foot with the effort to overcome his emotion at the sight of that man who had shared the intimacies of his domestic life as though he had been a grown-up son.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">"She believed in your return,"</said> he said solemnly.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> lifted his hanging head.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"She was a wise woman. How could I fail to come back --?</said></p>
            <p>He finished the thought mentally: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Since she has prophesied for me an end of poverty, misery, and starvation."</said> These words of her anger, from the circumstances in which they had been uttered, like the cry of a soul prevented from making its peace with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#God">God</rs>, stirred that obscure residue of superstition from which even the greatest genius among men of adventure and action is seldom free, reigned over his mind with the force of a potent malediction. He had been orphaned so early that he could remember no other woman whom he called mother. It seemed to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> that hence forth there would be no enterprise in which he would not fail. It had begun already. The dread of that conviction made him stamp his foot. He spoke as if in a suppressed furry.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Come, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">vie jo</rs>! Get me something to eat! Sangre de <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#God">Dios</rs>! This hunger makes me light-headed."</said></p>
            <p>With his chin dropped again upon his bare breast above his folded arms, barefooted, watching from under a gloomy brow the movements of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Viola</rs>, foraging amongst empty cupboards, he seemed as if indeed fallen under a curse -- a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">ruined and sinister Capataz</rs>.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Old Viola</rs> walked out of a dark corner<cb n="923.390.3"/> carrying his joined hands before him, and without a word emptied upon the table out of his hollowed palms a few dry crusts of bread and half a raw onion.</p>
            <p>While the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> began to devour this beggar's fare, taking up with a sort of stony-eyed voracity piece after piece lying by his side, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Garibaldino</rs> went off, and squatting down in another corner filled an earthenware mug with red wine out of a wicker-covered demijohn. With a familiar gesture, as when serving customers in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">café</placeName>, he had thrust his pipe between his teeth to have his hands free.</p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> drank greedily. A slight flush deepened the bronze of his cheek. Before him, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Viola">Viola</rs>, with a turn of his white and massive head towards the staircase, took his empty pipe out of his mouth, and pronounced slowly:</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Viola">"After the shot was fired down here, which killed her as surely as if the bullet had struck her poor tormented heart, she called upon you to save the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">children</rs>. Upon you, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Gian' Battista</rs>."</said></p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> lifted his glistening eyes.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Did she do that, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Padrone</rs>?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">"Si... I am old,"</said> muttered <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Georgio <!-- sic for Giorgio --> Viola</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">"Life lasts too long sometimes, but death lasts for ever."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"She called upon me -- and then --"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">"She spoke no more."</said> The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">heroic follower of Garibaldi</rs>, as the thought of the eternal stillness and silence fallen upon the shrouded form stretched out on the bed upstairs, averted his face and raised his hand to his furrowed brow. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">"She was dead before I could seize her hands,"</said> he stammered out, pitifully.</p>
            <p>Before the wide eyes of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>, staring at the doorway of the dark staircase, floated the shape of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">Great Isabel</placeName>, like a strange ship in distress, freighted with enormous wealth and the solitary life of a man. It was impossible for him to do anything. He could only hold his tongue, since there was no one to trust. The treasure would be lost, probably -- unless <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">the man</rs>... And his thought came abruptly to an end. He perceived that he cold not imagine in the least what <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs> was likely to do.</p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Old Viola</rs> had not stirred. And the motionless <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> dropped his long, soft eyelashes, which gave to the upper part of his fierce, black-whiskered face a touch of feminine ingenuousness. The silence had lasted for a long time.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"God keep her soul,"</said> he murmured, uneasily.</p>

            <p>The next day was quiet in the morning, except for the faint sound of firing to the northward, in the direction of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#losHatos">Los Hatos</placeName>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> had listened to it from his balcony anxiously. The phrase, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell_CM">"In my delicate position as the only consular agent then in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">port</placeName>, everything, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, everything was a just cause for anxiety,"</said> had its place in the more or less stereotyped relation of the <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"historical events"</said> which for the next few years was at the service of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">distinguished strangers</rs> visiting <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>.

But on the main line mail-boat days he was down at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN"><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> office</placeName> at the very break of day, with his own gig manned by a smart crew in white and blue, ready to dash off and board the ship directly she showed her bows between the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> heads.</p>
            <p>And it would be into the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN"><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> office</placeName> that he would invite some <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">privileged passenger</rs> he had brought off in his own boat to take a seat for a moment while he signed a few papers. And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, seating himself at a desk, would keep on talking hospitably:</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"There isn't much time if you are to see everything in a day. We shall be off in a moment. We'll have lunch at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">Amarilla Club</placeName> -- though I belong also to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Anglo-Saxon">Anglo-Saxon</placeName> -- <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mining">mining engineers</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#business">business men</rs>, don't you know! -- and to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Miliflores">Mirliflores</placeName>, a new club -- <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#French">French</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Italians">Italians</rs>, all sorts -- lively young fellows mostly, who wanted to compliment an old resident, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>. But we'll lunch at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">Amarilla</placeName>. Interest you, I fancy. Real thing of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">country</placeName>. Men of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#OccidentalFamilies">first Occidental families</rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ribiera">President of the Republic</rs> belongs to it, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>. Fine old bishop with a broken nose in the patio. Remarkable piece of statuary, I believe. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Parrochetti">Cavaliere Parrochetti</rs> -- you know <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Parrochetti">Parrochetti</rs>, the famous Italian sculptor -- was working here for two years -- thought very highly of the old .... There, I am very much at your service now."</said></p>
            <p>Inflexible, proud of his experience, penetrated by the sense of historical importance of men, events, and buildings, he talked pompously in jerky periods, with slight indicating sweeps of his short, thick arm, letting nothing <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"escape the attention"</said> of his <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">privileged captive</rs>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Lot of building going on, as you observe; before the Separation it was a plain of burnt grass smothered in clouds of dust, with an ox-cart track to our <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Jetty">Jetty</placeName>. Nothing more. This is the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">Harbour Gate</placeName>. Picturesque, is it not? <cb n="923.391.2"/> Formerly the houses stopped there -- <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Calle">Calle de la Constitution</placeName>. Observe the old Spanish houses. Great dignity Eh? I suppose it's just as it was in the time of the Viceroys except for the pavement. Wood blocks now. <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoBank">Sulaco National Bank</placeName> that with the sentry boxes each side of the gate. <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Avellanos">Casa Avellanos</placeName> this side, with all the ground-floor windows shuttered. A wonderful woman lives there -- <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Miss Avellanos</rs> -- the beautiful <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs>. A character, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>! A historical woman! Opposite -- <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">Casa Gould</placeName>. Noble <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">gateway</placeName>. Yes, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Goulds">Goulds</rs> of the original <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">Gould Concession</placeName>, that all the world knows of now. I hold seventeen of the thousand-dollar shares in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">Consolidated San Tomé mines</placeName>. The savings of my life-time, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, and it will be enough to keep me in comfort to the end of my days at home when I retire. Something to leave behind one, too. I have a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MitchellFamily">niece</rs> -- married a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MitchellFamily">parson</rs> -- most worthy man, incumbent of a small <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#England">parish in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#England">Sussex</placeName></placeName>; no end of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MitchellFamily">children</rs>. I was never married. A sailor should exercise self-denial. Standing under that very <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">gateway</placeName>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, I saw the first and last charge of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs>'s Llaneros</rs> upon <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BarriosMen"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs>'s troops</rs>, who had just taken the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour"><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> gate</placeName>. They could not stand <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs>'s new rifles. In a moment the street became blocked with a mass of dead men and horses. They never came on again."</said></p>
            <p>And all day <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> would talk like this to his <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">more or less willing victim</rs>: <said>"The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">Plaza</placeName>. I call it magnificent. Four times the area of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#England">Trafalgar Square</placeName>."</said></p>
            <p>From the very centre, in the blazing sunshine, he pointed out the buildings: <said>"The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">Intendencia</placeName>, now <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">President's Palace</placeName> -- <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">Cabildo</placeName>, where the Lower Chamber of Parliament sits. You notice this side is all new houses. <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Anzani">Compania Anzani</placeName>, the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Anzani">great general store</placeName> like those co-operative things at home. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Anzani">Old Anzani</rs> was murdered by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuards">National Guards</rs> in front of his safe. It was even for that specific crime that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">deputy Gamacho</rs>, commanding the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuards">Nationals</rs>, a sort of savage brute, was executed publicly by garrote upon the sentence of court-martial ordered by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs>. All that side had been burnt; used to be colonaded before. A terrible fire, by the light of which I saw the last of the fighting, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Llaneros">Llaneros</rs> flying, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard">Nationals</rs> throwing their arms down, and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#miners">miners of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé</placeName></rs>, all <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#natives">Indians from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sierra">Sierra</placeName></rs>, rolling by like a torrent to the sound of pipes and cymbals, green flags flying, a wild mass of men in white ponchos and green hats, on foot, on mules, on donkeys. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#miners">miners</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, had marched upon the town, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Pepe">Don Pepé</rs> leading on his black horse, and their very wives in the rear on burros, ululating, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, and beating tambourines. I remember one had a green parrot sitting on her shoulder, as calm as bird of stone. Such a sight, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, will never be seen again. They had just saved <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">their Señor Administrador</rs>; for <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs>, though he ordered the assault at once, at night (a thunderstorm going on over the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gulf">Gulf</placeName>, too), would have been too late. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito Montero</rs> had <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs> out to be shot -- like his <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldUncle">uncle</rs> many years ago -- and then, as <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs> said, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">"<placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> would not have been worth fighting for."</said> <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> without the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">Concession</placeName> was nothing; and there were tons and tons of dynamite distributed all over the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mountain</placeName> with detonators arranged, and an <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Roman">old snuffy priest</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Roman">Father Romàn</rs>, standing by to<cb n="923.391.3"/> annihilate the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName> at the first news of failure. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs> had made up his mind not to leave it, and he had the right men to see to it, too."</said></p> 
            <p>Thus <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> would talk in the middle of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#plaza">Plaza</placeName>, holding over his head a white umbrella with a green lining; but inside the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Cathedral">Cathedral</placeName>, in the dim light, with a faint scent of incense floating in the cool atmosphere, and here and there a kneeling female figure, black or all white, with a veiled head, his lowered voice became solemn.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Here,"</said> he would say, pointing to a niche in the wall of the dusky aisle, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"is the bust of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Avellanos">Don José Avellanos</rs>, 'Patrio and Statesman,' as the inscription says, 'Minister to Courts of England and Spain, &amp;c., died in the woods of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#LosHatos">Los Hatos</placeName> worn out with his life-long struggle for right and justice at the dawn of the new ear.' A fair likeness. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Parrochetti">Parrochetti</rs>'s work from some old photographs and a pencil sketch by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>. I was well acquainted with that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Avellanos">distinguished Spanish-American of the old school</rs>, a true Hidalgo, beloved by everybody who knew him. The marble medallion in the wall, in the antique style, representing a veiled woman seated with her hands clasped loosely over her knees is in memory of that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">unfortunate young gentleman</rs> who sailed out with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> on that fatal night, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>. See, <said>'To the memory of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Martin Decoud</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">his betrothed Antonia Avellanos</rs>.'</said> Frank, simple, noble. There you have that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">lady</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, as she is. An exceptional woman. Those who thought she would give way to despair were mistaken, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>. She has been blamed in many quarters for not having taken the veil. It was expected of her. But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Doña Antonia</rs> is not the stuff they make nuns of."</said></p>
            <p>Directly outside, on the very top of the noble flight of steps, his voice rose pompously, his arm found again its sweeping gesture. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">" '<placeName ref="serPlace.xmlPorvenir">Porvenir</placeName>,' over there on that first floor above those French plate-glass shop-fronts; our biggest daily. Conservative, or, rather, I should say, Parliamentary. We have the Parliamentary Party here of which the actual <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Lopez">Chief of the State</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Juste">Don Juste Lopez</rs>, is the head; a very sagacious man, I think. A first-rate intellect, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>. And the Democratic party in opposition, resting mostly on these <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Italians">Socialistic Italians</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, with their secret societies, camorras, and such like. There are lots of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Italians">Italians</rs> settled here on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway lands</placeName>, dismissed navvies, mechanics, and so on, all along the trunk line. There are whole villages of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Italians">Italians</rs> on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Campo">Campo</placeName>. And the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#natives">natives</rs>, too, are being drawn in -- <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#AmericanBar">American bar</placeName>? Yes. And over there you can see another. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#NorthAmericans">New Yorkers</rs> mostly frequent that one -- Here we are at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">Amarilla</placeName>."</said></p> 
            <p>And the lunch would begin and terminate its lavish and leisurely course at a little table in the gallery; <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> nodding, bowing, getting up to speak for a moment to different <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#officials">officials</rs>in black clothes, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#merchants">merchants</rs> in jackets, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#officers">officers</rs> in uniform, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">middle-aged caballeros</rs> from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Campo">Campo</placeName> -- <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">sallow, little nervous men</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">fat, placid, swarthy men</rs>, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Europeans">Europeans</rs> or <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#NorthAmericans">North Americans</rs> of superior standing, whose faces looked very white and eyes very cold amongst the mass of dark complexions and black, glistening eyes.</p>         </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="3.12.420">
            <head>CHAPTER XII. (continued)</head>     
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> would lay back a little, casting around looks of satisfaction and tender over the table a case full of thick cigars.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Try a weed with your coffee. Local tobacco. The black coffee you get at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">Amarilla</placeName>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, you don't meet anywhere in the world. We get the bean from a famous cafeteria in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#foothills">foot hills</placeName>, whose owner sends three sacks every year as a present to his fellow members in remembrance of the fight against <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuard"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gamacho">Gamacho</rs>'s mob</rs>, carried on from this very window by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#villagers">caballeros</rs>. He was in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName> at the time, and took part, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, to the bitter end. It arrives on three <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#animal">mules</rs> -- not in the common way, by rail, oh, no! -- right into the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">patio</placeName>, escorted by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#peons">mounted peons</rs>, in charge of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#coffee">Mayoral of his estate</rs>, who walks upstairs booted and spurred, and delivers it to our committee formally with the words <said who="serOgraphies.xml#coffee">'For the sake of those fallen on the third of May.'</said> We call it 'Tres de Mayo' coffee. Taste it.</said></p>
            
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, with an expression as though making ready to hear a sermon in church, would lift the tiny cup to his lips. And the nectar would be sipped to the bottom during a restful silence in a cloud of cigar smoke.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Look at this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Caballero</rs> in black going out,"</said> he would begin, leaning forward hastily. <said>"This is the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">famous Hernandez</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Minister of Police</rs>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Times">"Times" special correspondent</rs>, who wrote that striking series of letters calling the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Occidental Republic</placeName> the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">treasure house of the world</placeName>, gave a whole article to him and the force he has organised -- the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">renowned Carabineers of the Campo</rs>."</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>'s guest</rs>, staring curiously, would see a figure in sober black walking gravely, with down-cast eyelids in a long, composed face, a brow furrowed horizontally, a pointed head, whose grey hair, thin at the top, combed down carefully on all sides and rolled at the ends fell low on the collar and shoulders of the coat. This was then the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">famous bandit</rs>. He put on a high-crowned sombrero with a vast flat brim; a rosary of wooden beads was twisted about his right wrist. And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> would proceed: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">protector of the Sulaco refugees</rs>. Visits at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Avellanos">Casa Avellanos</placeName> and the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">Casa Gould</placeName>. As the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">general of the cavalry</rs> with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs> he distinguished himself at the storming of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Tonoro">Tonoro</placeName>, where <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Senor Fuentes</rs> was killed with the last remnant of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monterists">Monterists</rs>. He is the friend and humble servant of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">Bishop Corbelàn</rs>. Hears three masses every day. I bet you he will step into the <cb n="930.420.2"/> <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Cathedral">Cathedral</placeName> to say a prayer or two on his way home to have his siesta."</said></p>
            <p>He took several puffs at his cigar in silence, then in his best important manner pronounced: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Spanish">Spanish race</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, is prolific of remarkable characters in every rank of life. I propose we go now into the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Amarilla">billiard room</placeName>, which is cool, for a quiet chat. There's never anybody there till after five. I could tell you episodes of the Separatist revolution that would astonish you. When the great heat's over, we'll take a turn on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Alamdea">Alameda</placeName>."</said></p>
            <p>The inflexible programme went on relentless, like a law of Nature. The turn on the<placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Alameda">Alameda</placeName> was taken with slow steps and stately remarks. <said>"All the great world of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> here, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>."</said> He bowed right and left with no end of formality; then with animation, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Doña Emilia</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> -- look. Always <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mules">white mules</rs>. The kindest, most gracious woman the sun ever shone upon. A great position, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>. A great position. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">First lady in Sulaco</rs> -- far before the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#RibieraFamily">President's wife</rs>. And worthy of it."</said> He took off his hat eagerly; then, with a studied change of tone, added, negligently, that the man in black by her side with high white collar and a scarred, snarly face was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Inspector of State Hospitals</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">chief medical officer of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">Consolidated San Tomé mines</placeName></rs>.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"A familiar of the house. Everlastingly there. No wonder. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Goulds">Goulds</rs> made him. Very faithful and all that, but I never liked him. Nobody does. I can recollect him limping about the streets in a check shirt and native sandals with a water-melon under his arm -- all he would get to eat for the day. A big-wig now, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, and as nasty as ever. However, there's no doubt he has done not a little at the time. He saved us all from the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">deadly incubus of Sotillo</rs> where a more particular man might have failed."</said></p>
            <p>His arm went up.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"The equestrian statue on that pedestal over there has been removed. It was an anachronism,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> commented obscurely, as if an anachronism were some sort of man or beast. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"There is some talk of replacing it by a marble shaft commemorative of Separation, with angels of peace at the four corners, and a bronze justice holding an even balance, all gilt, on top. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Parrochetti">Cavaliere Parrochetti</rs> was asked to make a design, which you can see framed under glass in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Intendencia">Municipal Sala</placeName>.

            <p>He dropped into a stone seat under a tree, and tapped invitingly at the place by his side.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"He carried to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs> the letters from <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> which decided the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">General</rs> to evacuate <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Cayta">Cayta</placeName> for a time, and come to our help here <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">by the sea</placeName>.  The transports were still in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> fortunately. Sir, I did not even know that my <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz de Cargadores</rs> was alive. I had no idea. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> came upon him in the deserted <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#custom">Custom-house</placeName>. I was never told; never given a hint, nothing -- as if I were unworthy of confidence. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Monygham</rs> arranged it all. He went to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway yards</placeName>, and got admission to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">engineer-in-chief</rs>, who, for the sake of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Goulds">Goulds</rs>, as much as for anything, consented to let an engine make a dash down the line, 180 miles, with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> aboard. In the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Construction">Construction Camp</placeName>, at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">rail-head</placeName> he obtained a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#animal">horse</rs>, arms, some clothing, and started alone on that marvellous ride -- 400 miles in six days, through a disturbed country, ending by a feat of passing through the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monterists"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monterists">Monterist</rs> lines outside <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Cayta">Cayta</placeName></placeName>. That ride, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, would make a most exciting book. He carried all our lives here in his pocket. Devotion, courage, fidelity, intelligence were not enough. Of course, he was perfectly fearless and incorruptible. But a man was wanted that would know how to succeed. He was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">that man</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>. On the fifth of May, being practically a prisoner in the <placeName  ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN">harbour office</placeName> of my company, I suddenly heard the whistle of an engine in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway yards</placeName>, a quarter of a mile away. I could not believe my ears. I made one jump on to the balcony, and beheld a locomotive under a great head of steam run screeching like made enveloped in a white could, and then, just abreast of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Viola</rs>'s inn</placeName>, check almost to a stand-still. I made out, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">a man -- I couldn't tell who</rs> -- dash out of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">Albergo</placeName>, climb into the cab, and then, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, that engine seemed positively to leap clear of the house, and was gone in the twinkling of an eye. As you blow a candle out, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>! There was a first-rate driver on the footplate, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, I can tell you. They were fired heavily upon by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#SulacoNationalGuards">National Guards</rs> in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Rincon">Rincon</placeName> and one other place. Fortunately the line had not been torn up anywhere. In four hours they were in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Construction">Construction Camp</placeName>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> had his start. The rest you know. You've got only to look round you. There are people on this <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Alameda">Alameda</placeName> that ride in their carriages, or even are alive at all to-day, because years ago I engaged a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">runaway Italian sailor</rs> for a foreman of our wharf simply on the strength of his looks. And that's a fact. You can't get over it, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>. On the seventeenth of May, just twelve days after I saw the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">man from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Albergo">Casa<cb n="930.421.1"/><pb n="421"/> Viola</placeName></rs> get on the engine, and wondered what it meant, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs>' transports were entering the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>, and the <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Times_'T'm">'<placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">treasure house of the world</placeName>,'</said> as the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Times">'Times' man</rs> calls <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> in his book, was saved from a most horrid fate. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs> with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">Hernandez</rs> on the west, and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#miners"><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé</placeName> miners</rs> pressing on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#landGate">land gate</placeName> was not able to oppose the landing. He had been sending messages to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> for a week to join him. Had <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> done so there would have been massacres, and proscription that would have left no man or woman of position here. But that's where <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> comes in. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs>, blind and deaf to everything, stuck on board his steamer watching them dragging for silver. They say that for the last three days he was out of his mind, raving and foaming with disappointment at getting nothing, flying about the deck, and yelling curses at the boats with the drags, ordering them in, and then suddenly stamping his foot and crying out, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">'And yet it is there!'</said></said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"He was preparing to hang <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> (whom he had on board) at the end of the after-derrick, when the first of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs>' transports, one of our own ships, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, steamed right in, and ranging close alongside opened a small-arm fire without as much as a formal hail. It was the completest surprise in the world, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>. They were too astounded at first to bolt below. Men were falling right and left like nine-pins. It's a miracle that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Monygham</rs>, standing on the after-hatch, with the rope already round his neck, escaped being riddled through like a sieve. He told me since he had given himself up for lost, and kept on yelling with all the strength of his lungs: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">'Hoist a white flag! Hoist a white flag!'</said> Suddenly an <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">old major</rs> standing by unsheathed his sword with a shriek: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#oldMajor">'Die! Perjured traitor!'</said> and runs <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sotillo">Sotillo</rs> clean through the body."</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> stopped for a while.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Begad, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>! I could spin you a yarn for hours,<!--sic--> But it's time we started off to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Rincon">Rincon</placeName>. It would not do for you to pass through <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> and not see the lights of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName>, a whole mountain ablaze like a lighted palace above the dark <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Campo">Campo</placeName>. It's a fashionable drive. But let me tell you one little anecdote, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>; just to show you. A fortnight or more later, when <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">declared Generalissimo</rs>, was gone in pursuit of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito</rs> away south, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Junta">Provisional Junta</rs> with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Juste">Don Juste Lopez</rs> at its head had promulgated the new Constitution, and one <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos Gould</rs> was packing up his trunks bound on a mission to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#UnitedStates">'Frisco</placeName> and <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#UnitedStates">Washington</placeName> (the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#UnitedStates">United States</placeName>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, were the first great power to recognise the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Occidental Republic</placeName>) -- a fortnight later, I say, when we were beginning to feel that our heads were still on our shoulders, if I may express myself so, a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSNshipper">prominent man</rs>, a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSNshipper">foreigner</rs>, a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSNshipper">large shipper</rs> by our line, came to see me on a business and, says he, the first thing: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#OSNshipper">'I say, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs>, is that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">fellow</rs> (meaning <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>) still the Capataz of your Cargadores or not?'</said> <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">'What's the matter?'</said> says I. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#OSNshipper">'Because, if he is, then I don't mind; I send and receive a good lot of cargo by your ships; but I see him apparently loafing about the wharf, and just now he stopped me as cool as you please, with a request for a cigar. Now, you know, my cigars are rather<cb n="930.421.2"/> special, and I can't get them so easily as all that.'</said> <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">'I hope you stretched a point,'</said> I said very gently. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#OSNshipper">'Why, yes. But it's a confounded nuisance. He's everlastingly cadging for smokes.'</said> Sir, I turned my eyes away, and then asked, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#OSNshipper">'Weren't you one of the prisoners in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Cabildo">Cabildo</placeName>?'</said> <said who="serOgraphies.xml#OSNshipper">'You know very well I was, and in chains, too,'</said> says he <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">'And under a fine of fifteen thousand dollars?'</said> he coloured, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, because it got about that he fainted from fright when they came to arrest him, and then behaved before <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Fuentes">Fuentes</rs> in a manner to make the very <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#FuentesMen">verdugos</rs>, who had dragged him there by the hair of his head, smile at his cringing. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#OSNshipper">'Yes,'</said> he says in a sort of shy way. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">'Oh, nothing. You stood to lose a tidy bit,'</said> says I. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">'What can I do for you?'</said> He never even saw the point. Not he. And that's how the world wags, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>."</said></p>
            <p>He rose a little stiffly, and the drive to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Rincon">Rincon</placeName> would be taken with only one philosophical remark uttered by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">merciless cicerone</rs> with his eyes fixed upon the lights of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé</placeName> that seemed suspended in the dark night between earth and heaven. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"A great power, this, for good and evil, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>. A great power."</said></p>
            <p>And the dinner of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Miriflores">Miriflores</placeName> would be eaten, excellent as to cooking, and leaving upon the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">traveller</rs>'s mind an impression that there were in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> many pleasant, able young men with their salaries apparently too large for their discretion, and amongst them a few, mostly Anglo-Saxon, skilled in the art of, as the saying is "taking a rise" out of their kind host.</p>  
            <p>With a rapid, jingling drive to the harbour in a two-wheeled machine (which <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> called a curricle) behind a fleet and scraggy mule beaten all the time by an obviously <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#neapolitanDriver">Neapolitan driver</rs>, the cycle would be nearly closed before the lighted-up <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN">offices of the O.S.N. Company</placeName> remaining open so late because of the steamer. Nearly -- but not quite.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Ten o'clock. Your ship won't be ready to leave till half past twelve, if by then. Come in for a brandy and soda, and one more cigar."</said></p>
            <p>And in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">superintendent</rs>'s private room</placeName> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">privileged passenger</rs> by the Minerva, or Juno, or Pallas, stunned and as it were annihilated mentally by a sudden surfeit of sights, sounds, names, facts, and complicated information imperfectly apprehended, would listen like a tired child to a fairy tale, would hear a voice familiar and surprising tell him as if from another world how there was <said>"in this very <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>"</said> an international naval demonstration, which put an end to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName>-<placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> War. How the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#UnitedStates">United States</placeName> cruiser Powhattan was the first to salute the Occidental flag -- white, with a wreath of green laurel in the middle encircling a yellow amarilla flower. Would hear how <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GeneralMontero">General Montero</rs>, in less than a month after proclaiming himself <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GeneralMontero">Emperor of Costaguana</rs>, was shot dead (during a solemn and public distribution of orders and crosses) by a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GeneralMonteroMistressFamily">young artillery officer</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GeneralMonteroMistressFamily">brother of his then <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GeneralMonteroMistress">mistress</rs></rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">abominable Pedrito</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, fled the country,"</said> the voice would say. And it would continue: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSNworkers">One of our Captains</rs> told me lately that he recognised <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Pedrito the Guerillero</rs>, arrayed in purple slippers and a smoking cap with a gold tassel, keeping<cb n="930.421.3"/> a disorderly house in one of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#southernPorts">southern ports</placeName>."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#MonteroPedro">Abominable Pedrito</rs>! Who the devil was he?"</said> would wonder the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">distinguished bird of passage</rs>, hovering on the confines of waking and sleep with resolutely open eyes and a faint but amiable curl upon his lips, from between which stuck out the eighteenth or twentieth cigar of that memorable day.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"He appeared to me in this very room like a haunting ghost, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>"</said> -- <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> was talking of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">his Nostromo</rs> with true warmth of feeling and a sort of wistful pride. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"You may imagine, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, what an effect it produced on me. He had come round by sea with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs>, of course. And the first thing he told me after I became fit to hear him was that he had picked up floating in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">gulf</placeName> the lighter's boat! He seemed quite overcome by that circumstance. And a remarkable enough circumstance it was, when you remember that it was then sixteen days since the sinking of the silver. At once I could see he was another man. He stared at the wall, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs> as if there had been a spider or something running about there. The loss of the silver preyed on his mind. The first thing he asked me about was whether <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Doña Antonia</rs> had heard yet of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs>'s death. I had to tell him no, that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Doña Antonia</rs>, as a matter of fact, was not then back in town yet. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Poor girl</rs>! And just as I was making ready to ask him a thousand questions, with a sudden <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">'Pardon me, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">señor</rs>,'</said> he cleared out of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN">office</placeName> altogether. I did not see him again for three days. I was terribly busy, you know. It seems that he wandered about in and out of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>, and on two nights turned up to sleep in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">baracoons</placeName> of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#railway">railway people</rs>. He seemed absolutely indifferent to what went on. I asked him on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#wharf">wharf</placeName> <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">'When are you going to take hold again, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>? There will be plenty of work for the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">Cargadores</rs>presently.'"</said></said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"<said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">'<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Señor</rs>,'</said> says he, looking at me in a slow, inquisitive manner, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">'would it surprise you to hear that I am too tired to work? And what work? How can I look <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">my Cargadores</rs> in the face after this?'</said></said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"I begged him not to be broken-hearted about the silver, and he smiled. A smile that went to my heart, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">'It was no mistake,'</said> I said. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">'It was a fatality. A thing that could not be helped.'</said> <said>'Si, si!'</said> he said, and turned away. I thought it best to leave him alone for a bit to get over it. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">Sir</rs>, it took him years to get over it! I was present at his interview with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs>. I must say that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Gould</rs> is rather a cold man. You understand, he had to keep a tight hand on himself, dealing with thieves and rascals, in constant danger of ruin for himself and wife for so many years. They looked at each other for a long time. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs> asked what he could do for him in his quiet, inexpansive way.</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"<said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">'My name is known from one end of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> to the other,'</said> he said, as quiet as the other. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">'What more can you do for me?'</said>That was all that time. Later on, however, there was a very fine coasting schooner for sale, cheap, here, and one night late he turned up at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">Casa Gould</placeName>, and asked <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldCharles">Don Carlos</rs> to lend him money enough to buy her. He paid it all back within three years. Business was booming<cb n="930.422.1"/><pb n="422"/> along this <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#coast">seaboard</placeName>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>. Moreover, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">this man</rs> has always succeeded in everything -- except the silver business. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Poor Doña Antonia</rs> had an interview with him. Wanted to hear about <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs>: what they said, what they did, what they thought up to the last. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> told me his manner was perfect for quietness and sympathy. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Miss Avellanos</rs> burst into tears only when he told her how <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs> had happened to say that his plan would be a glorious success. And there's no doubt, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">sir</rs>, that it is. It is."</said></p>
            <p>The cycle was about to close at last. And while the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#visitor">privileged passenger</rs>, shivering with the pleasant anticipations of his berth, forgot to ask himself, "What on earth Decoud's plan could be?" <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> was saying, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">"Sorry we must part so soon. Your intelligent interest in everything made it a pleasant day to me. I shall see you now on board. You had a glimpse of the '<placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Treasure House of the World</placeName>.' A very good name."</said> And the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSNworkers">coxswain</rs>'s voice at the door, saying that the gig was ready, closed the cycle.</p></div> 
        <div><head>CHAPTER XIII</head> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> had, indeed, found the lighter's boat floating empty well out in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">gulf</placeName>. He was standing on the bridge of the first of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs>' transports steaming up the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">gulf</placeName>, and within less than a couple of hours' steaming from <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs>, who had taken a great liking to his bravery, kept him near his person during all the passage, and often addressed himself to him with that abrupt and familial manner which is the visible sign of high favour.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s eyes were the first to catch, wide on the bow, a tiny, elusive dark speck, which, alone with the forms of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Isabels">three Isabels</placeName> right ahead, appeared on the flat, shimmering emptiness of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">Gulf</placeName>. There are times when no fact should be neglected as insignificant; a small boat so far out in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">Gulf</placeName> might have had some meaning worth finding out. At a nod of consent from <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs> the transport swept out of her course, passing near enough to ascertain that no one manned the little cockle-shell. It was merely a common small boat gone adrift with her oars in her. But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, to whose mind <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs> had been insistently present for days, had long before recognised with excitement the dinghy of the lighter.</p> 
            <p>There could be no question of stopping to pick up that thing. Every minute of time was momentous with the lives and futures of a whole <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">town</placeName>. And the head of the leading ship, with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">general</rs> on board, fell off to her course. Behind her, the fleet of transports, scattered haphazard over a mile or so in the offing like the finish of an ocean race, pressed on, all black and smoking on the western sky.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Mi General</rs>,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s voice rang out loud, but quiet, from behind a group of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#BarriosMen">officers</rs>, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I should like to save that little boat. Por Dios, I know her. She belongs to my company."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">"And, por Dios,"</said> guffawed <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs> in a nervous, noisy, good-humoured voice at the prospect of a fight, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">"you belong to me. I am going to make a captain of cavalry out of you directly we get within sight of a horse again."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I can swim far better than I can<cb n="930.422.2"/> ride, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">mi General</rs>,"</said> cried <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, pushing through to the rail with a set stare in his eye. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Let me--"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">"Let you? What a conceited fellow that is,"</said> bantered the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">General</rs>, jovially, without even looking at him. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">"Let him go! Ha! ha! ha! He wants me to admit that we cannot take <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> without him! Ha! ha! ha! Would you like to swim off to her, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">my son</rs>?"</said></p>
            <p>A tremendous shout from one end of the ship to the other stopped his guffaw. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> had leaped overboard; and his black head bobbed up far away already from the ship. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">General</rs> muttered an appalled <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">"Cielo! Sinner that I am!"</said> in a thunderstruck tone. One anxious glance was enough to show him that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> was swimming with perfect ease; and then he thundered terribly, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">"No! no! We shall not pick up this <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">impertinent fellow</rs>. Let him drown that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">mad Capataz</rs>."</said></p>
            <p>Nothing short of main force would have kept <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> from leaping overboard. That empty little boat, coming out to meet him mysteriously, as if rowed by an invisible spectre, exercised the fascination of some sign, of some warning evoked by the absorption of his feelings in the perplexities of action and conscience. It concreted in a startling and enigmatic way, the persistent thought of a treasure and of a man's fate. He would have leaped if there had been death in that half-mile of water. It was as smooth as a pond, and for some reason sharks are unknown in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">Placid Gulf</placeName>, though on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#PuntaMala">other side of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#PuntaMala">Punta Mala</placeName></placeName> the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#coast">coastline</placeName> swarms with them.</p> 
            <p>He seized hold of the stern and blew with force. A queer, faint feeling had come over him while he swam, and he had to get rid of his boots and coat in the water. He had to get his breath. In the distance the transports, more in a bunch now, held on straight for <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> with their air of friendly contest, of nautical sport, of a regatta; and the united smoke of their funnels drove like a thin, sulphurous fogbank right over his head. It was his daring, his courage, his act that had set them in motion upon the sea. With a vigorous and skilful effort he clambered in. The very boat. No doubt of it; no doubt whatever. It was the dinghy of the lighter No.3 -- the dinghy left with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Martin Decoud</rs> on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">great Isabel</placeName> so that he should have some means to help himself if nothing could be done for him from the shore. And here she had come out to meet him, empty and mysterious. What had become of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs>? The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> made a minute examination. He looked for some scratch, for some mark, for some sign. All he discovered was a brown stain on the gunwale, right aft. He put his face close to it; rubbed hard with his finger. Then he sat down in the stern sheets, passive, with knees close together and legs aslant.</p> 
            <p>Streaming from head to foot, with his hair and whiskers hanging lank and dripping, and a lustreless stare fixed upon the bottom boards, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores"><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> Cargadores</rs></rs> resembled a resuscitated corpse of a drowned man come up from the bottom to idle away the sunset hour in a small boat. The excitement of his adventurous ride, the excitement of the return in time, of achievement of success, all this excitement centred round the associated ideas<cb n="930.422.3"/> of the great treasure and of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">only other man who knew of its existence</rs>, had departed from him. To the very last moment he had been excitedly cudgelling his brains as to how he could manage to visit the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">Great Isabel</placeName> without loss of time and undetected. For the idea of secrecy had come to be connected with the treasure so closely that even to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs> himself he had refrained from mentioning the existence of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs> and of the treasure on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">island</placeName>. The letters he carried to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">General</rs>, however, made brief mention of the loss of the silver as having its bearing upon the situation in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>. In the circumstances, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">one-eyed tiger-slayer</rs>, scenting battle from afar, had not wasted his time in making inquiries from the messenger. In fact, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs>, talking with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, assumed that both the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">man</rs> and the ingots were lost, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, not questioned directly, had kept silent, under the influence of some indefinable modification of resentment and distrust. Let <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Don Martin</rs> speak of everything for himself was what he told himself mentally.</p>  
            <p>And now, with the means of gaining the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">Great Isabel</placeName> thrown thus in his way at the earliest possible moment, his excitement had departed, as when the soul takes flight leaving the body inert upon an earth it knows no more. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> did not seem to know the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">Gulf</placeName>. For a long time even his eyelids did not flutter upon the glazed emptiness of his stare. Then slowly, without a limb having stirred, without a twitch of muscle or quiver of an eyelash, an expression, a living expression, came upon the features, deep thought crept into the empty stare -- as if an outcast soul, a quiet, reflective, sombre soul, finding that untenanted body in its way had come in stealthily to take possession.</p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> frowned, and in the immense stillness of sea, sky, <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Isabels">islands</placeName>, <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#coast">coast</placeName>, cloud forms and trails of light upon the water, the knitting of that brow had the emphasis of a vast and powerful gesture. Nothing else budged for a long time, then the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> shook his head and again seemed to surrender himself to the universal repose of all visible things. Suddenly he seized the oars, and with one movement made the dinghy spin round head on to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">Great Isabel</placeName>. But before he began to pull he bent once more over the brown stain on the gunwale. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I know that thing,"</said> he muttered to himself, with a knowing jerk of the head. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"That's blood."</said></p> 
            <p>His stroke was long vigorous, and steady. Now and then he looked over his shoulder at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">Great Isabel</placeName>. He flung, rather than dragged, the boat on the little beach. At once, turning his back upon the sunset, he plunged with long strides into the ravine.</p>
            <p>A mass of earth, grass, and smashed bushes had fallen down very naturally from above upon the roots of the leaning tree. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs> had attended to the concealment of the silver as instructed; using the spade with some intelligence. But <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s half-smile of approval changed into a scornful curl of the lip by the sight of the spade itself flung there in full view, as if in utter carelessness or sudden panic, giving away the whole thing. Ah! They were all alike in their folly, these <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#hombresFinos">hombres finos</rs> that invented laws and governments and barren tasks for the people.</p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> picked up the spade, and<cb n="930.423.1"/><pb n="423"/> with the feel of the handle in his palm the desire of having a look at the horse-hide boxes of treasure came upon him suddenly. In a very few strokes he uncovered the edges and corners of several; then, clearing away more earth, became aware that one of them had been slashed with a knife.</p> 
            <p>He exclaimed at that discovery in a stifled voice, dropped on his knees with a look of irrational apprehension over one shoulder, then over the other. The stiff hide had closed, and he hesitated before he pushed his hand through the long slit and felt the ingots inside. There they were. One, two, three. Yes, four gone. Taken away. Four ingots. But who? <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs>? Nobody else. And why? For what purpose? For what cursed fancy? Let him explain. Four ingots carried off in a boat, and -- blood!</p> 
            <p>In the face of the open <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">Gulf</placeName>, the sun, clear, unclouded, unaltered, plunged into the waters in a grave and untroubled mystery of self-immolation consummated far from all mortal eyes, with an infinite majesty of silence and peace. Four ingots short!</p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> got up slowly.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"He might simply have cut his hand,"</said> he muttered. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"But, then--"</said></p> 
            <p>He sat down on the soft earth, unresisting, as if he had been chained to the treasure, with his drawn-up legs clasped in his hands with an air of hopeless submission, like a slave set on guard. Once only he lifted his head smartly; the rattle of hot musketry fire had reached his ears; like pouring from on high a stream of dry peas upon a drum. After listening for a while he said, half aloud:</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"He will never come back to explain."</said></p> 
            <p>And he lowered his head again.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Impossible!"</said> he muttered, gloomily.</p> 
            <p>The sounds of firing died out. The loom of a great fire in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> flashed up red above the coast, played on the clouds at the head of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">gulf</placeName>, seemed to touch with a ruddy and sinister reflection the forms of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Isabels">Three Isabels</placeName>. He never saw it, though he raised his head.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"But then I cannot know,"</said> he pronounced, distinctly, and remained silent and staring for hours.</p> 
            <p>He could not know. Nobody could know. As might have been supposed, the end of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Don Martin Decoud</rs> was subject of speculation for no one. Had the truth of the facts been known, there would always have remained the question, Why? Whereas the version of his death at the sinking of the lighter had no uncertainty of motive. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">young apostle of Separation</rs> had died striving by an ever-lamented accident in action, as it were. Whereas the truth was that he died from solitude, the enemy known but to few on this earth, and that only the simplest of us are fit to withstand. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">brilliant Costaguanero of the boulevards</rs> had died from solitude and idleness.</p>
            <p>For some good and valid reasons beyond mere human comprehension, the sea-birds of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">gulf</placeName> shun the Isabels. The rocky head of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Azuera">Azuera</placeName> is their haunt, whose stony levels and chasms resound with their wild and tumultuous clamour, as if they were for ever quarrelling over the legendary treasure. At the end of his first day on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">Great Isabel</placeName>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs>, turning in his lair of coarse grass under a big tree, said to himself, <said>"I have not seen as much as one single bird all day."</said></p><cb n="930.423.2"/>
            <p>And he had not heard a sound, either, all day but that one now of his own muttering voice. It had been a day of silence -- the first of his life. And he had not slept a wink. Not for all those sleepless nights and days of fighting, planning, talking; not for all the mental excitement; not for all that last night of danger and hard physical toil upon the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">gulf</placeName>, had he been able to close his eyes for a moment. And yet from sunrise to sunset he had been lying prone, either on his back or on his face.</p> 
            <p>He stretched himself, and with slow steps descended into the gully to spend the night by the side of the silver. If <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> returned -- as he may have done at any moment -- it was there that he would look first; and night would, of course, be the proper time for an attempt to communicate. He remembered with profound indifference that he had not eaten anything yet since he had been left alone on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">island</placeName>.</p> 
            <p>He spent the night open-eyed, and when the day broke he ate something with the same indifference. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">brilliant "son, Decoud,"</rs> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">spoiled darling of the family</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">lover of Antonia</rs>, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">journalist of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName></rs>, was not fit to encounter solitude. Solitude, from a mere outward condition of existence, becomes very swiftly a state of soul in which the affectations of irony and scepticism have no place. It takes possession of the mind and drives the thought into another sort of unbelief. After three days of waiting for the sight of some human face, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs> caught himself entertaining a doubt of his own individuality. It seemed to have merged into the world of clouds and water, the world of natural forces and forms of nature.</p> 
            <p>Not a living being, not a speck of distant sail, appeared within the range of his vision; and, as if to escape from this solitude, he absorbed himself in his melancholy. Sleeplessness had robbed his being of all energy; for he had not slept seven hours in the seven days. His sadness was the sadness of a sceptical mind. He beheld the universe as a succession of incomprehensible images. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> was dead. Everything had failed ignominiously. He dared not think of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs>. She had not survived. He would never dare face her. Never! A desperate bitterness of mind and heart prevented him from attempting to save himself. All exertion seemed senseless. For what? And what could he attempt?</p> 
            <p>On the tenth day, after a night spent without even dozing off once (it had occurred to him that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Antonia</rs> could not possibly have loved a being so base), the solitude appeared like a great void, and the silence of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">Gulf</placeName> like a tense thin cord to which he hung suspended by both hands, without emotion, without fear, without surprise, without any sort of sentiment whatever. Only towards evening, in the comparative relief of coolness he began to imagine that the cord could snap. He imagined it snapping with a report as of a pistol a sharp, full crack. And that would be the end of him. He contemplated that eventuality with pleasure, because he dreaded the nights in which the silence, unbroken as ever, contained a voice.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">"I wonder whether I should hear it snap before I fell?"</said> he asked himself.</p> 
            <p>The sun was still two hours above the horizon when he got up, gaunt, dirty, white-faced, and looked at it with his<cb n="930.423.3"/> scorched eyes. His limbs obeyed him yet -- slowly, heavily, as if full of lead, but without tremor; and the effect of that physical condition gave to his actions a sort of unhesitating, deliberate dignity. He moved as if accomplishing solemnly a rite. He descended into the gully; for the fascination of all that silver, with its potential power, survived alone outside himself. He picked up the belt with the revolver that was lying there, and buckled it round his waist. The cord could not snap on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">island</placeName>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">"I must fall and sink into the sea,"</said> he thought. And sink! He was looking at the loose earth covering the treasure. His aspect was that of a somnambulist as he lowered himself down on his knees slowly and went on grubbing with his fingers with industrious patience till he uncovered one box of ingots. Without a pause, without fumbling, as if doing some work done many times before, he slit it open and took four of the little bars, which he put in his pockets. Then he covered the exposed box again, and, step by step. came out of the gully. The bushes swished after him.</p> 
            <p>On the third day of his solitude he had pushed the dinghy into the water with an idea of rowing away somewhere, but had desisted at some last whisper of a lingering hope. Now, to be set afloat she wanted only a slight shove. He had eaten a little every day after the first. He had some muscular strength; and taking up the oars slowly he pulled away from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">cliff-end of the Great Isabel</placeName> which stood behind him radiating a heat as of life, bathed in a rich light from head to foot as if in a radiance of hope and joy. He pulled straight towards the setting sun. When the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">gulf</placeName> had grown dark he stopped and flung the sculls in. The hollow clatter was the loudest noise he had ever heard in his life. It was a revelation. It seemed to recall him from far away. Actually the thought  <said>"perhaps I may sleep to-night"</said> passed through his mind. But he remained sitting on the thwart.</p> 
            <p>The dawn from behind the mountains drove the night out of his wide-open unwinking eyes. It was a clear daybreak, and at last the sun appeared above the peaks of the range. The great <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">Gulf</placeName> burst into glitter all around the boat, and in this splendid and merciless solitude the silence appeared stretched taut like a thin string.</p> 
            <p>His eyes looked at it while without haste he shifted his seat from the thwart to the gunwale. They looked at it fixedly while his hand feeling about his waist unbuttoned the flap of the revolver case, drew the weapon, cocked it, brought it forward pointing at his breast, and pulled the trigger, and with convulsive force sent the arm hurling through the air. They looked at it while he fell forward and hung on the gunwale with the fingers of his right hand hooked under the thwart. They looked . . .</p> 
            
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">"It is done,"</said> he stammered in a sudden flow of blood. His last thought was: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">"I wonder how that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> died."</said> Then the fingers relaxed, and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">lover of Antonia</rs> rolled overboard without having heard the cord of silence snap aloud in the silence of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">Placid Gulf</placeName> whose glittering surface was hardly troubled by the fall of his body.</p> 
            <p>A victim of that disillusioned weari<cb n="930.424.1"/><pb n="424"/>ness which is the retribution meted out to intellectual audacity, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">brilliant Don Martin Decoud</rs>, weighted by the bars of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé</placeName> silver, disappeared without a trace, swallowed up in the immense indifference of things. His sleepless, crouching figure was gone from the side of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé</placeName> silver; and for a time the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#spirits">spirits of good and evil</rs> that hover near every concealed treasure of the earth might have thought that it was forgotten by all mankind. Then, after a few days, another form appeared striding away from the setting sun to sit motionless in the narrow black <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">gully</placeName> all through the night, in nearly the same pose, in nearly the same place in which had sat that other sleepless man who had gone away for ever so quietly in a small boat about the time of sunset. And the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#spirits">spirits of good and evil</rs> that hover about a forbidden treasure knew that the silver of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé</placeName> was provided now with a faithful and lifelong slave.</p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">magnificent Capataz de Cargadores</rs>, victim of the disenchanted vanity which is the reward of audacious action, sat in the weary pose of a hunted outcast through a night of sleeplessness as tormenting as any known to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs>, his companion in the most desperate affair of his life. And he wondered how <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs> had died. First a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTeresa">woman</rs>, then a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">man</rs> abandoned each in the last extremity for the sake of this accursed treasure. A sort of still horror was succeeded by a gust of immense pride. There was no one in the world but <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Gian' Battista Fidanza</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz de Cargadores</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">incorruptible and faithful Nostromo</rs>, to pay such a price.</p><cb n="930.424.2"/>
            <p>He had made up his mind that nothing should be allowed now to rob him of his bargain. Nothing. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs> had died. But how? That he was dead he had not a shadow of a doubt. But four ingots? . . . What for? Did he mean to come for more?</p> 
            <p>The treasure was putting forth its latent power. It troubled the clear mind of the man who had paid the price. He was sure that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#DecoudMartin">Decoud</rs> was dead. The island seemed alive with that whisper. Dead! Gone! And he caught himself listening for the swish of bushes and the splash of the foot-falls in the bed of the brook. Dead! The talker, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">novio of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#AvellanosAntonia">Doña Antonia</rs></rs>!</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Ha!"</said> he murmured with his head on his knees under the livid clouded dawn breaking over the liberated Sulaco and upon the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#gulf">Gulf</placeName> as grey as ashes. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"It is to her that he will fly. To her that he will fly!"</said></p> 
            <p>And four ingots! Had he taken them in revenge, to cast a spell, like the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTeresa">woman who had prophesied poverty and starvation</rs>, and laid upon him the task of saving the children? Well, he had saved them. What else? But for him <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldEmilia">Doña Emilia Gould</rs> would have lost all, to the very roof over her head.</p> 
            <p><said who="serPersons.xl#Nostromo_CdC">"It will be the worse for him,"</said> he said. And then he got up after hours of immobility. He, too, had been betrayed.</p> 
            <p>And the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> looked down at the downfall of loose earth, stones, and smashed bushes covering the silver of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName>.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I must grow rich very slowly,"</said> he reflected half aloud.</p> 
            <p>(To be concluded.)</p> 
        </div>
        <div type="chapter" n="3.14.453">
            <head>CHAPTER XIV</head> 
            <p>It was a slow growth. <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> out-stripped him, growing rich on the hidden treasures of the earth, hovered over by the anxious spirits of good and evil, torn out by the labouring hands of the people. It was like a second youth, like a new life, full of promise, of unrest, of toil, scattering lavishly its wealth to the four corners of an excited world. Material changes swept along in the train of material interests. And other changes more subtle, outwardly unmarked, affected the minds and hearts of its people. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> had gone home to live on his savings invested in the <placeName ref="SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName>; and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> had grown older, with his head steel-grey and the unchanged expression of his face, living on the inexhaustible treasure of his devotion drawn upon stealthily in the secret of his heart like a store of unlawful wealth.</p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Inspector-General of State Hospitals</rs> (whose maintenance is a charge upon the Gould Concession), <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Official Adviser on Sanitation to the Municipality</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Chief Medical Officer of the San Tomé Consolidated Mines</rs> (whose territory, containing gold, silver, copper, cobalt extends for miles along the foot-hills of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Cordillera">Cordillera</placeName>), had felt poverty-stricken, miserable, and starved during the prolonged visit the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Goulds">Goulds</rs> had paid to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Europe">Europe</placeName> and the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#UnitedStates">United States of America</placeName>. Intimate familiar of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">Casa</placeName>, proved friend, a bachelor, without ties and without establishment (except of the professional sort) he had been asked to take up his quarters in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">Gould house</placeName>. In the eighteen months of their absence these familiar rooms, recalling at every glance the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">woman to whom he had given all his loyalty</rs>, had grown intolerable. As the day approached for the arrival of the mail-boat Hermes (the latest addition to the O.S.N. Co.'s splendid fleet), the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> hobbled about more vivaciously, snapped more sardonically at simple and gentle out of sheer childish nervousness.</p> 
            <p>He packed up his modest trunk with speed, with fury, with enthusiasm, and saw it carried out past the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#gateKeeper">old porter</rs> at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">gate</placeName> of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">Casa Gould</placeName> with delight, with intoxication; then, as the hour approached, sitting alone in the great landau behind the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#mule">white mules</rs>, a little sideways, his drawn-up face positively venomous with the effort of self-control, and a pair of new gloves in his left hand, he drove to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName>.</p> 
            <p>His heart felt dilated within him so awfully that his greetings on the deck of the steamer were reduced to a casual mutter. Driving back to the town all<cb n="107.453.2"/> three were silent. And in the patio the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, in a more natural manner, said:</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I'll leave you now to yourselves. I'll call to-morrow, if I may?"</said></p> 
            <p><said>"Come to lunch, dear <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, and come early,"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>, in her travelling dress and her veil down, turning to look at him at the foot of the stairs; while at the top of the flight the Madonna, in blue robes, and the Child on her arm, seemed to welcome her with an aspect of pitying tenderness.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Charles">"Don't expect to find me at home,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Charles">Charles Gould</rs> warned him. <said>"I'll be off early, to the mine."</said></p> 
            <p>After lunch <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Doña Emilia</rs> and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Señor Doctor</rs> came slowly through the inner gateway of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">patio</placeName>, and the large <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">gardens</placeName> of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">Casa Gould</placeName>, surrounded by high walls and the rich red tile slopes of neighbouring roofs, lay open before them, with masses of shade under the trees and level surfaces of sunlight upon the lawns. A triple row of old orange trees surrounded the whole, and gardeners, brown, barefooted, in snowy white shirts and wide calzoneras, dotted the ground, squatting over flower beds, passing between the trees dragging slender India-rubber tubes across the gravel, and the fine jets of water crossed each other in graceful curves, sparkling in the sunshine with a slight pattering noise upon the bushes, and an effect of showered diamonds upon the grass.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Doña Emilia</rs>, holding up the train of a clear dress, walked by the side of Dr. Monygham, in a longish black coat and severe cravat on an immaculate shirt front. And under a shady clump of trees, where there were tables, wicker chairs, hammocks, Mrs. Gould sat down in a low and ample seat.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Don't go yet,"</said> she said to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, who, unable to tear himself away from the spot, his chin nestled in his collar devoured her stealthily with his eyes, which, luckily, were round and hard like clouded marbles, and incapable of disclosing any sort of sentiment; his pitying emotion at the signs of time upon the delicate face of that woman; that air of frailty and weary fatigue that had settled upon the eyes and temples of the <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Pepe">"Never-tired Señora"</said> (as <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Pepe">Don Pepé</rs> years ago used to call her with admiration), touched him almost to tears. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Don't go yet. To-day is all my own,"</said> Mrs. Gould urged gently. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"We are not back yet officially. To-morrow evening the windows of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">Casa Gould</placeName> will be lighted for our arrival."</said></p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> dropped into a chair.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"A tertulia,"</said> he said, with a detached air.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"All welcome of greeting for all those friends who care to come."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"And only to-morrow?"</said></p><cb n="107.453.3"/> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Yes. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Charles">Charles</rs> would be tired out after a day at the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">mine</placeName>, and so I --.

It has seen all my life.<!--sic (no end quote)--></said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Ah, yes!"</said> snarled the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Moygham">Doctor</rs> suddenly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Women count time from the marriage feast. Didn't you live a little before?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Yes, but what is there to remember? There were no cares."</said></p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> sighed. And as two friends, after a long separation, will revert to the most agitated period of their lives, they began to talk of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> Revolution. It seemed strange to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> that people who had taken part in it seemed to forget its memory and its lesson.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"And yet,"</said> struck in the Doctor, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"we all played our part in it and had our reward. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Pepe">Don Pepé</rs>, though superannuated, still can sit a horse. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs> is drinking himself to death in jovial company away somewhere on his fundacion beyond the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Tonoro">Bolson of Tonoro</placeName>. And the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Roman">heroic Father Romàn</rs> -- I imagine the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Roman">old padré</rs> blowing up systematically the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé mine</placeName>, uttering a pious exclamation at every bang, and taking up handfuls of snuff between the explosions -- the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Roman">heroic Padré Roman</rs>! He says that he is not afraid of the harm the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#HolroydMissionaries">missionaries</rs> can do to his flock, as long as he is alive."</said></p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> shuddered slightly.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Ah, but you, old friend?"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I did the work I was fit for."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"You faced a most cruel danger. Something more than death."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"No, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>! Only death -- by hanging -- as it seemed to turn out, and I am rewarded beyond my deserts."</said></p> 
            <p>He said this with fire, but noting <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>'s gaze fixed upon him he dropped his eyes.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#DR">"I've made my career -- as you see,"</said> he said, taking up lightly the lapels of his superfine black coat. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>'s recovered self-respect, marked inwardly by the almost complete disappearance from his dreams of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Maiz">Father Maiz</rs>, appeared visibly in what, by contrast, seemed an immoderate cult of his personal appearance. Carried out within severe limits of form and line and in perpetual freshness, this change of apparel gave to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> an air at the same time professional and festive, while his gait and the unchanged crabbed character of his face acquired from it a startling and grotesque force.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Yes"</said> he went on. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"We all had our rewards -- the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#EIC">Engineer-in-Chief</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> --"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"We saw him,"</said> interrupted <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> in her charming voice. <said>"The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">poor old man</rs> came up from the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#England">country</placeName> on purpose to call upon us in our <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#England">hotel</placeName> in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#England">London</placeName>. He comported himself with<cb n="107.454.1"/><pb n="454"/> great dignity, but I fancy he regrets <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>. He rambled feebly about 'historical events' till I felt I could have a cry."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"H'm,"</said> grunted the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>. <said>"Getting old, I suppose. Even <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> is getting older -- though he is not changed. And, speaking of that fellow, I wanted to tell you especially --"</said></p>
            <p>For some time the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gould">house</placeName> had been full of murmurs, of signs of agitation. Suddenly the two <rs ref="serPersons.xml@GouldServants">gardeners</rs>, busy with rose trees on the side of the garden arch, fell upon their knees with bowed heads on the passage of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Antonia">Antonia Avellanos</rs> walking beside her <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">uncle</rs>.</p>
            <p>Invested with the red hat after a short visit to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Italy">Rome</placeName>, where he had been invited by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Propaganda">Propaganda</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">Father Corbelàn</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">missionary to the wild Indians</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">conspirator</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">friend and patron of Hernandez the robber</rs>, advanced with big, slow strides, gaunt, and leaning forward, with his powerful hands knotted behind his back. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">first Cardinal-Archbishop of Sulaco</rs> had preserved his fanatical and morose air; the aspect of a chaplain of bandits. It was believed that his elevation was a counter-move to the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Protestant">Protestant</rs> invasion of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> organised by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#HolroydMissionary">Holroyd Missionary Fund</rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Antonia">Antonia</rs>, maturer, slightly fuller in form, advanced with her light walk and her high serenity, smiling from a distance at <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>. She had brought her <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">uncle</rs> over to see <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">dear Emilia</rs>, without ceremony, just for a moment before the siesta.</p>
            <p>When all were seated again, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, who had come to dislike heartily everybody who approached <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>, kept aside, plunged in profound meditation, till a louder phrase of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Antonia">Antonia</rs> made him lift his head.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Antonia">"How can we abandon groaning in slavery, under oppression, those who have been our countrymen only a short while ago, who <emph>are</emph> our countrymen now? How can we remain blind, and deaf, and without pity to the cruel wrongs suffered by our brothers. There is a remedy."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Annex the rest of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName> to the order and prosperity of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>,"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"There is no other remedy."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Antonia">"I am sure,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Antonia">Antonia</rs> said calmly, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Antonia">"that this was from the first <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">poor Martin</rs>'s intention."</said></p>   
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Yes, but the material interests will not let you jeopardise their development for an idea of pity and justice,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> muttered grumpily.</p>
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">Cardinal-Archbishop</rs> straightened up his gaunt, bony frame.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan_C-A">"We have worked for them; we have made them, these material interests,"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"And without them you are nothing,"</said> cried the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mongyham">Doctor</rs> from the distance.</p>
            <p>A silence ensued, during which <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">his Eminence</rs> stared, frowning at the ground, and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Antonia">Antonia</rs>, graceful and rigid in her chair, breathed calmly in the strength of her invincible convictions. Then the conversation took a social turn, turning on the visit of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Goulds">Goulds</rs> to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Europe">Europe</placeName>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">Cardinal-Archbishop</rs>, when in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Italy">Rome</placeName>, suffered from neuralgia in the head all the time. It was the climate -- the bad air.</p>
            <p>When <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">uncle</rs> and <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Antonia">niece</rs> had gone away, with the servants again falling on their knees and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#gateKeeper">old porter</rs>, almost totally blind, creeping up to kiss <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">His Eminence</rs>'s extended hand, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>,<cb n="107.454.2"/> looking after them, pronounced the one word:</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Incorrigible!"</said></p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>, with a look up, dropped wearily on her lap her white hands flashing with the gold and stones of many rings.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Conspiring. Yes!"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>. <said who= "serOgraphies.xml#Monygham_dr">"The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Antonia">last of the Avellanos</rs> and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">last of the Corbelàns</rs>. They are conspiring with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#refugees">refugees from Sta. Marta</rs> that flock here after every revolution. The <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Plaza">Café Lambroso</placeName> at the corner of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Plaza">Plaza</placeName> is full of them; you can hear their chatter across the street like the noise of a parrot-house. They are conspiring for the invasion of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Costaguana">Costaguana</placeName>. And do you know where they go for strength, for the necessary force? To the secret societies amongst immigrants and natives, where <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> -- I should say <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Captain Fidanza</rs> -- is the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">great man</rs>. What gives him that influence? Who can say? Genius? He has genius. He is greater with the populace than ever. He has a secret power; and he has conferences with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Corbelan">Archbishop</rs>, as in the old days which you and I remember. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Barrios">Barrios</rs> is hopeless. But for a military head they have the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Hernandez">pious Hernandez</rs>. And they may raise the country with the old cry of the land for the people."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Will there be never any peace? Will there be no rest?"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> whispered. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"I thought that we --"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"No!"</said> interrupted the Doctor. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"There is no peace and no rest in the development of material interests. They have their law and their justice. But it is founded on expediency, and is inhuman; it is without rectitude, without the continuity and the force that can be found only in a moral principle. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>, the time approaches when all that the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">Gould Concession</placeName> stands for shall weigh as heavily upon the people as the barbarism, cruelty, and misrule of a few years back."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Is it that we have worked for, then?"</said> she asked, in a sad murmur. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> lowered his head. He could follow her silent thought. Was it for that her life had been robbed of all the intimate felicities of daily affection which her tenderness needed as the human body needs air to breathe? And the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, indignant with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Charles">Charles Gould</rs>, began to talk calmly:</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"It is about <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> that I wanted to talk to you. Ah! that fellow has some continuity and force. Nothing will put an end to him. But never mind that. There's something inexplicable going on -- or perhaps only too easy to explain. You know, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">Linda</rs> is practically the lighthouse keeper of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">Great Isabel</placeName> <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#light">light</placeName>. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Garibaldino</rs> is too old now. His part is to clean the lamps and to cook in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lightCottage">house</placeName>; but he can't get up the stairs any longer. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">black-eyed Linda</rs> sleeps all day and watches the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#light">light</placeName> all night. Not all day, though. She is up towards five in the afternoon, when <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">our Nostromo</rs>, whenever he is in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> with his schooner, comes out on his courting visit, pulling in a small boat."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Aren't they married yet?"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> asked. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"The mother wished it, as far as I can understand, while <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">Linda</rs> was yet quite a child. When I had the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">two girls</rs> here for a year or so during the War of Separation that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">extraordinary Linda</rs> used to say quite simply that she was going to be <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Gian' Battista</rs>'s wife</rs>."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"They are not married yet,"</said> said the<cb n="107.454.3"/> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, curtly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I have looked after them a little."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Thank you, dear <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>,"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>; and under the shade of the big trees her little, even teeth gleamed in a youthful smile of gentle malice. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"People don't know how really good you are. You will not let them know, as if on purpose to annoy me, who have pinned my faith in your good heart long ago."</said></p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs>, with a lifting up of his upper lip, as though he were longing to bite, bowed stiffly in his chair. With the utter absorption of a man to whom love comes late, not as a most splendid of illusions, but like an enlightening and priceless misfortune, the sight of that woman (of whom he had been deprived for about eighteen months) suggested ideas of adoration, of kissing the hem of her robe. And this excess of feeling translated itself naturally by an augmented grimness of speech.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"I am afraid of being overwhelmed by too much gratitude. However, these people interest me. I went out several times to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">Great Isabel</placeName> <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#light">light</placeName> to see <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Giorgio</rs>."</said></p>
            <p>He did not tell her that it was because he found there, in her absence, a sort of congenial atmosphere in <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Giorgio</rs>'s austere admiration of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">English signora</rs> -- the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">benefactress</rs>; in <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">black-eyed Linda</rs>'s voluble, torrential, passionate affection for <said>"our <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Doña Emilia</rs> -- that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">angel</rs>"</said>; in the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">silent, white-throated fair Giselle</rs>'s adoring upward turn of the eyes, which then glided towards him with a sideways, half-arch, half-candid glance, which made the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> exclaim to himself mentally, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"If I weren't what I am, I would think the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">sly minx</rs> is making eyes at me. And perhaps she is. Dare say she would make eyes at anybody."</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs> said nothing of this to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">providence of the Viola family</rs>, but reverted to what he called <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">our great Nostromo</rs>."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"What I wanted to say is this: <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Our great Nostromo</rs> did not seem to take much notice of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old man</rs> and the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">children</rs>. It's true, too, that he was away on his coasting voyages certainly, ten months out of the twelve. He was making his fortune, as he told <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> once. He seems certainly to have done uncommonly well. It was only to be expected. He is a man full of resource, full of confidence in himself, ready to take chances and risks of every sort. I remember being in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#OSN"><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Mitchell</rs>'s office</placeName> one day when he came in with that calm, grave air he always has, at home, everywhere. He had been away trading in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#NorthAmerica">Gulf of California</placeName>, he said, looking straight past us at the wall, as his manner is, and was glad to see on his return that a <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#light">lighthouse</placeName> was being built on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">cliff-part</placeName> of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">Great Isabel</placeName>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Mitchell</rs> explained that it was the O.S.N. Co. who was building it, for the convenience of the mail service, on his own advice. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Captain Fidanza</rs> was good enough to say that it was excellent advice. I remember him twisting up his moustaches and looking all round the cornice of the room before he proposed that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Giorgio</rs> should be made the keeper."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"I heard of this. I was consulted,"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> said. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"I doubted whether it would be good for these girls."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"The proposal fell in with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Garibaldino</rs>'s humor. As to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">Linda</rs>, any place was lovely and delightful enough<cb n="107.455.1"/><pb n="455"/> as long as it was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s suggestion. She could wait for her <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Gian' Battista</rs>'s good pleasure there as well as anywhere else. My opinion is that she was always in love with that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">grave and mysterious personality</rs>. Moreover, they wanted to get <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">Giselle</rs> away from the attentions of a certain <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ramirez">Ramirez</rs><!--sic (missing an "r" in original text: Ramiez)-->."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Ah!"</said> said <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>, interested. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ramirez">Ramirez</rs><!--sic (missing an "r" in original text: Ramiez)-->! What sort of man is that?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Just a <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ramirez">mozo of the town</rs>. He was, as a matter of fact, recommended by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Mitchell">Captain Mitchell</rs> for Capataz of the Company's <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">stevedores</rs>. He strutted round, and tried to play the part of a second <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>. But the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#cargadores">fraternity of the Cargadores</rs> very soon put a stop to that. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Old Giorgio</rs> could not bear him -- called him a blind esclavo, an empty head, without sense, heart without honour; not like his model of perfection, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">his Gian' Battista</rs>, the incarnation of the honesty, the fidelity, the superiority of 'the people.' They both, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Spartan</rs> and that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">great white-faced Linda</rs> with her red mouth and coal-black eyes, are looking rather fiercely after the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">fair one</rs>. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GiorgioViola">Old Viola</rs>, who is king on <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">his island</placeName>, will not allow anyone to remain after half-past six. Even <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Captain Fidanza</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">incorruptible Nostromo</rs>, has to take his leave before dark. Why should he stay longer? <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">Linda</rs> goes up to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#light">light</placeName> then. Now comes the strange part. For some time past, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Captain Fidanza</rs>, whenever his schooner is in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>, has been observed to enter the harbour, pulling himself in a small boat, long after midnight. Where does he spend his time? I mean after he has left the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Viola">old lighthouse-keeper</rs>, and when <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">Linda</rs> is up with the light. He ought to be back at eight at the latest. It is impossible to believe that he floats for six hours or so in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gulf">Gulf</placeName> for the fun of the thing. Last time <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> was here, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ramirez">Ramirez</rs>, who dares not approach <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Viola</rs>, plucked heart of grace, and spoke about it to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">Linda</rs> one Sunday when she came ashore to go to <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#church">church</placeName> and pay a visit to her mother's grave. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">Linda</rs> was never so unrelenting towards <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ramirez">Ramirez</rs> as the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old man himself</rs>. I fancy she would not be sorry to see the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">other</rs> fairly married. The question is, at what does <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Captain Fidanza</rs> employ all these hours between seven and midnight. He goes away at seven right enough."</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> had sat up, opening her eyes very wide.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"What do you mean, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>? Do you mean to say that you suspect the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">younger sister</rs>?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Who can tell. Quien sabe"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs>, rising to take leave.</p>

            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"It would be the best thing for him"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> remarked dryly. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"But who is to speak to him? Who would dare? No one in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName>. Even the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ramirez">miserable Ramirez</rs> goes whimpering to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">Linda</rs> rather than face the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">incomparable man</rs>."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"I will"</said> cried <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Tell him to come and see me."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"And do you think he would come?"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">doctor</rs> asked, ironically. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Even you can't command <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Captain Fidanza</rs>. But if you wish me, I shall try. Only he looks upon me as an enemy of longstanding. And, you know, he wouldn't even have the trouble of exerting himself. There is not a man in the<cb n="107.455.2"/> working population of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> who wouldn't undertake to make me meet with some ugly accident just to ingratiate himself with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Captain Fidanza</rs>. Half of our new <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#townPolice">town police</rs> are members of one or other of these camorras honoured by the membership of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Captain Fidanza</rs>. Shall I speak to him?"</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"No, no! I forbid you!"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> cried, hastily. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"I -- I think I'll send for the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">girls</rs> -- or for the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">father</rs> himself."</said></p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"It would be much better. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Old Viola</rs> shall know how to take care of his honour."</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> meditated. She had the fate of these <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">girls</rs> very much at heart. But to-morrow -- officially the first day of her presence in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> -- would be very full, with a two o'clock dinner-party for the intimate <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#GouldFriends">friends</rs> adhering to the ancient style of living, and a great reception in the evening.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"I shall ask the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Garibaldino</rs> to come and see me the day after,"</said> she thought to herself. The thing was impossible. There would be some very simple explanation. Perhaps the best thing would be to say nothing at all to anybody.</p>
            <p>And after the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Doctor</rs> had gone away she leaned back in her chair, in the shade of the big trees planted in a circle. She leaned back with closed eyes and her hand lying idle in her lap, small and dainty, with a youthful prettiness in the half light, clad in gossamer fabrics and delicate laces, like a good fairy wearied with a long career of well-doing, touched by the withering suspicion of the uselessness of her labours, the powerlessness of her magic.</p>
        </div>
        <div><head>Chapter XV</head>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> had been growing rich very slowly; it was an effect of his prudence, for <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">that man</rs> could command himself even when thrown off his balance. And to become <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">the slave of a treasure</rs> with full self-knowledge is an occurrence rare and mentally disturbing. But it was also in a great part because of the difficulty of converting it into a form in which it could become available. The mere act of getting hold of it piecemeal, little by little, was surrounded by difficulties, by the dangers of imminent detection. He had to visit the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Isabels">Isables</placeName> in secret, between his voyages along the coast, which were the ostensible source of his fortune. The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#NostromoCrew">crew</rs> of his own schooner were like so many spies upon <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">their dreaded captain</rs>. He did not dare stay too long in port. When his coaster was unloaded he had to go out on another trip, for he feared arousing suspicion even by a day's delay. Sometimes during a week's stay, or more, he could only manage one visit -- no more. He suffered through his fears as much as through his prudence. To do things by stealth humiliated him. And he suffered most from the concentration of his thought upon the treasure as thought becomes concentrated upon a vision of horror and pain. Never did his unblemished reputation appear more vividly as a matter of life and death.</p>
            <p>A transgression, a crime, entering a man's existence eats it up like a malignant growth, consumes it like a fever. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> cursed often the silver of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé Mine</placeName>, and cast black looks at <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Charles">Charles Gould</rs> when he happened to pass him on the other side of street. He hated the feel of the touch of the ingots. After handling them, with the door of his cabin on board the schooner locked,<cb n="107.455.3"/>he looked fixedly at his fingers, as surprised they had left no stain on his skin.</p>
            <p>He had found means of disposing of them in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ports">distant ports</placeName>. This is what made his coasting voyages long, and caused his visits to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lightCottage">Viola household</placeName> to be rare and far between. He was fated to have his wife from there. He had said so once to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Giorgio</rs> himself. But the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old man</rs> had put the question aside with a majestic wave of his hand, clutching a smouldering black briar-root pipe. There was plenty of time; he was not going to force <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">his girls</rs> upon anybody.</p>
            <p>As time went on he discovered his preference for the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">younger of the two</rs>. This must have been owing to some profound similarities of nature, which must exist for complete confidence and understanding, no matter what outward resemblances of temperament there may be to exercise their own fascination of contrast. His wife would have to know. He was much attracted  by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">Giselle</rs>, with candid gaze and white throat, pliable, silent, a lover of indolence and excitement; whereas <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">Linda</rs>, with her intense, passionately pale face, energetic, all fire, and words touched with gloom and scorn, a chip of the old block, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">true daughter of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">austere republican</rs></rs>, but with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaTeresa">Teresa</rs>'s voice, inspired him with a deep-seated mistrust. Moreover, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">poor girl</rs> could not conceal her love for <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Gian' Battista</rs>. He could see it would be violent, exacting, suspicious, uncompromising -- like her soul. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGisell">Giselle</rs>, by her fair but warm beauty, by the surface quietness of her nature holding a promise of submissiveness, by the charm of girlish mysteriousness, excited his passion and allayed his fears as to the future.</p>
            <p>His absences from <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName> were long. On returning from the longest of them he made out that lighters of material were lying under the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">cliff of the Great Isabel</placeName>, with cranes and scaffoldings above, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighthouse">workmen</rs>'s figures moving about, and the small <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#light">lighthouse</placeName> already rising from its foundations on the edge of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">cliff</placeName>.</p>
            <p>He thought himself lost. What could save him? Nothing! <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">splendid Capataz</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">feared Captain Fidanza</rs>, a power in the bosom of secret societies, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">republican</rs> like the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">austere Giorgio</rs>, and revolutionist in his heart too (but in another manner), was on the point of jumping overboard. This man, subjective almost to madness, looked suicide in the face for something like a quarter of a second. But he never lost his head. He sailed close. He observed that the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#lighthouse">workmen</rs> had no occasion to come near the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">ravine</placeName>. He learned in <!-- is port part of harbor or is this port somewhere else? --><placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">port</placeName> that no one slept on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">island</placeName>. They all returned to the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#harbour">harbour</placeName> at sunset in an empty material lighter, towed by a tug. He breathed freely.</p>
            <p>Ah! but what afterwards! When a lighthouse-keeper would come to live in the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#lightCottage">cottage</placeName> that was being built some 150 yards from the brow of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">cliff</placeName>, and about four hundred from the edge of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">ravine</placeName>! What then?</p>
            <p>And the idea came into his head to get <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Viola</rs> appointed for the post. He would live there with the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaChildren">girls</rs>. He loved solitude. He would probably allow no other man on the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">island</placeName>.</p>

            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"She is innocent,"</said> the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs> was saying in a deep and level voice, as though afraid that a louder word would break the slender hold his spirit still kept upon his body. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"She is innocent. It is I alone. But no matter. For these things I would answer to no man or woman alive."</said></p> 
            <p>He paused. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> stood like a statue. Her face, very white within the shadow of the hood, had an air of invincible and dreary sadness. And the low sobs of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">Giselle Viola</rs>, kneeling at the end of the bed, with her gold hair with coppery gleams loose and scattered over the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>'s feet, hardly troubled the silence of the room.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Ha! <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">Old Giorgio</rs> -- the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">guardian of thine honour</rs>! Fancy the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">viejo</rs> coming round so light of foot, so steady of aim. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> himself could have done no better. But the price of a charge of powder might have been saved. The honour was safe . . . . <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Señora</rs> she would have followed to the end of the world <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo the thief</rs>. . . . I have said the word. The spell is broken!"</said></p> 
            <p>A low moan from the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">girl</rs> made him cast his eyes down.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I cannot see her. . . . No matter,"</said> he went on, with the shadow of the old magnificent carelessness in his voice. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"One kiss is enough, if there is no time for more. An airy soul, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Señora</rs>! Bright and warm, like sunshine, soon clouded, and soon serene. They would crush it there between them. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Señora</rs>, cast the eye of your compassion, as far-famed as the courage and daring of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">the man</rs> who speaks to you, from one end of the land to the other. She will console herself with <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ramirez">Ramirez</rs>. He is not a bad fellow. I am not angry. No! It is not <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Ramirez">Ramirez</rs> who overcame the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz of the Sulaco Cargadores</rs>."</said> He paused, made an effort, and in louder voice a little wildly declared:</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"I die betrayed -- betrayed by --"</said> But he did not say by whom or by what he was dying betrayed.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"But she did not,"</said> he began again, opening his eyes very wide, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"she was faithful. We were going away -- soon. I could have torn myself away from that accursed treasure for her. For that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">child</rs> I would have left boxes and boxes of it full. And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Decoud</rs> took four. Why? Ha! Picardia. To betray me. How could I give back the treasure with four ingots missing? You would have said I had purloined them."</said></p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> bent low as if fascinated by the horror that trembled in her voice.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Tell me, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, have you killed <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Martin">Don Martin Decoud</rs> for that silver?"</said></p> 
            <p>An expression of unutterable scorn came upon that rigid face.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"You are all alike, you <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#hombresFinos">fine people</rs>. The silver has killed me. It has held me. It holds me yet. Nobody knows where it is. But you are the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">wife of Don Carlos</rs>, who put it into my hands and said: <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">'Save it on your life.'</said> And when I returned, and you all thought it was lost, what do I hear? It was nothing of importance. Let it go. Up, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>, the faithful, and ride away to save us, for dear life!"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Nostromo!"</said> <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> whispered, bending very low. <said>"I, too, have been<cb n="107.457.1"/><pb n="457"/> guilty of deception about that very silver."</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Marvellous!"</said> breathed out the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>, with an imperceptible irony. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Señora</rs>, nobody knows where it is. It is lost!"</said></p> 
            <p>His transgression had eaten up his life, seemed to have decomposed, corrupted his personality. A grimace of effort and pain settled on his face.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">"Shall I tell you where it is to be found? Is it your wish? I will try to."</said></p>
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> averted her head in obscure sympathy, in dread, in pity:</p> <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"No, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Capataz</rs>,"</said> she said. <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Let it be lost for ever."</said></p> 
            <p>After hearing these words <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> closed his eyes; answered no word, made no movement. At the door of the room <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>, excited to the highest pitch, his eyes shining with eagerness, ran up to her:</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Now, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>,"</said> he said, almost brutally in his impatience, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"tell me, was I right? There is a mystery. You have got the word, have you not? He told you --"</said></p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"He told me nothing,"</said> said Mrs. Gould steadily.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">"Ah!"</said> The light of his temperamental enmity to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs> went out of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Monygham">Dr. Monygham</rs>'s eyes. He stepped back submissively. He did not believe <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>. Her word was law. He accepted her will like an inexplicable fatality affirming the victory of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Nostromo</rs>'s genius over his own. Even before that <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">woman</rs>, whom he loved with secret devotion, he had been defeated by the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">magnificent Capataz de Cargadores</rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">the man</rs> who had lived his own life on the assumption of unbroken fidelity and courage!</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Pray send your volante for my carriage,"</said> spoke <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> from within her hood. Then turning to <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">Giselle Viola</rs>, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Come near me, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">child</rs>; come closer. We will wait here."</said></p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">Giselle Viola</rs>, heartbroken and child-like, her face veiled in her falling hair, crept closer and closer. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs> slipped her hand through the arm of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">unworthy daughter of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Viola</rs></rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">immaculate republican</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">hero without a stain</rs>. Slowly, gradually, as a withered flower droops, the head of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">girl who would have followed a thief to the end of the world</rs>, rested on the shoulder of <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Doña Emilia</rs>, the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">first lady in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Sulaco">Sulaco</placeName></rs>, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">wife of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Charles">Señor Administrador of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé Mine</placeName></rs></rs>. And <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Mrs. Gould</rs>, feeling the suppressed sobbing, nervous and excited, had the first and only movement of cynical bitterness in her life:</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">"Console yourself, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">child</rs>. Very soon he would have forgotten you, living by his side, for his treasure."</said></p> 
            <p>On seeing <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiselle">his youngest daughter</rs> run and disappear in the night, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Viola</rs> dropped the gun from his nerveless fingers. <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">Linda</rs>, rigid, silent, helped him into the house, then stepped back and looked at <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">her father</rs>, with her coal-black eyes blazing in the light of the lamp, with her long face of passionate whiteness, where her red lips seemed like an open wound.</p> 
            <p>The <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Garibaldino</rs> looked around; moved three steps with difficulty, and sat down in a chair.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">"Give me the book,"</said> he said with an inflexible calm.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">"And is the book of avail to you?"</said> she asked.</p>
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">"Yes,"</said> said the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old man</rs>, austerely.</p><cb n="107.457.2"/> 
            <p>She laid it, closed before him in its worn leather cover, the Bible given him years, ages ago by an <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Englishman">Englishman in <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Palmero">Palmero</placeName></rs>.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">"Where are you going?"</said> he asked mournfully.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">"To the light,"</said> she answered in a dead voice, looking at him balefully.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">"Si-duty,"</said> he mumbled.</p> 
            <p>He felt in the pocket of his red flannel shirt for his spectacles, sitting very upright, white haired, leonine, heroic in his terrible quietness. The spectacles given him by <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">Doña Emilia</rs>. How could he ever show his face before the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Emilia">English señora</rs>? Dishonoured! Disgraced!</p> 
            <p>Methodically he put on the silver-rimmed glasses, then opened the Book, and looked at the pages of small print in double columns. He looked at them from on high, then fell slowly forward. He fell, rugged, robust, undecayed, like an old oak uprooted by a tempest. His face rested on the open pages, his hands seemed to steady him, spread out and gripping the edges of the table. A wooden clock, of German make, was ticking on the wall; and growing slowly cold the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaGiorgio">old Garibaldino</rs> lay alone, uprooted by the tempest.</p> 
            <p>It was a moonlight night, and in the wide and <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gulf">placid gulf</placeName> the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#light">light</placeName> of the <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#GreatIsabel">Great Isabel</placeName> burned peacefully above the lost treasure of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#SanTome">San Tomé</placeName>, like bright beacon upon the shoals of crime and corruption. In the cold, bluish sheen of the starless night the lantern was full of a warm yellow glow, on which a black speck might have been detected from afar. It was <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">Linda</rs>, crouching in the outside gallery, on her knees, her forehead resting against the rail. She did not move. And the moon from the west seemed to look at her radiantly.</p> 
            <p><rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">Linda stood</rs>. Her black figure detached itself on the lighted background, erect, tense, narrow, with the arms flung up above her head as though she were going to throw herself headlong into the sea.</p> 
            <p><said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">"Ah! She shall not have thee, <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Battistino</rs> my own,"</said> she whispered madly. <said>"She shall not have thee. And she will forget thee miserably killed at her feet. But I, unhappy, shall never forget thee. Never!"</said></p> 
            <p>Her voice had been rising to the word never. She seized the rail with a convulsive clutch, and leaning out her body, with her face like marble in the moonlight, she cried out in her pain, with a piercing voice, <said who="serOgraphies.xml#ViolaLinda">"<rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">Gian' Battista</rs>!"</said></p> 
            <p>From the deep <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Gulf">head of the gulf</placeName>, full of black vapour, and walled by immense mountains from <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#PuntaMala">Punta Mala</placeName> round to the west of <placeName ref="serOgraphies.xml#Aznexa">Aznexa</placeName><!--possibly a typo for Azuera-->, where the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#gringos">obscure gringos</rs>, dead in life and living in death, guard the legendary treasure, out upon the ocean with a bright line marking the illusory edge of the world, where a great white cloud hung brighter than a mass of silver in the moonlight, in that cry of a longing heart sending its never-ceasing vibration into a sky empty of stars the genius of the <rs ref="serOgraphies.xml#Nostromo">magnificent Capataz de Cargadores dominated the place</rs>.</p>
